"1","   It is nine p.m. on the East Coast, and the moment of truth has arrived.     "
"2","   Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.    I'm Megyn Kelly...         Nice.      Tonight, thousands of people here in the Q, along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate, answering the questions you want answered.    "
"3","   Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination.         Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls.  Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17.  And now, the prime-time event, the top 10.     "
"4","   As for the candidates who will be answering those questions?  Here they are.    Positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump.         "
"5","   Neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.         "
"6","   It might be.  It might be.  We'll see.     :  Is this in the rules?  An objection's coming.    "
"7","   It might be.  The rules for tonight are simple.  One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups.  And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this.    Pleasant, no?    We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.    And while we expect them...         Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight.    Without further ado, let's begin.     "
"8","   Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions.  So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.    Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.    Mr. Trump.         Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.    "
"9","   The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.    "
"10","   And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.    You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?     "
"11","   So tonight, you can't say if another one of these...      "
"12","   OK.      "
"13","   Dr. Paul.      "
"14","   OK.      "
"15","   Just to be clear, you can't make a -- we're gonna -- we're going to move on.      You're not gonna make the pledge tonight?      "
"16","   OK.  Alright.            "
"17","   Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.      You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn.      Your critics say that your inexperience shows.  You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.      Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?      "
"18","   Governor Bush, you have insisted that you're your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own.  Not your father's, not your brother's.      But there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, ""the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office.""      So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?      "
"19","   Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter.  However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.     You've called women you don't like ""fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.""          Your Twitter account...    "
"20","   No, it wasn't.         "
"21","   For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.    "
"22","   Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks.  You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.  Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?     "
"23","   Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives.  You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state.  On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.    This -- this may be why.  Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades.  The state's 44th in private sector growth.  You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country.  So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?     "
"24","   Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.  You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it.  Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?    "
"25","   Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.  You later said that that statement, you could have said it better.  But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, ""Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years.""    Why are you so quick to blame your own party?    "
"26","   Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.  You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor.  Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?  "
"27","   Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.      Governor Christie.  You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.      Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing he bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?      "
"28","   Go ahead, sir.      "
"29","   Governor Christie, make your point.      "
"30","   Go ahead, governor.      "
"31","   Alright.      "
"32","   Alright, we've gotta cut it off there.      We have plenty more we want to get to.  That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.      "
"33","   Well, I want to move on, because I have -- we're gonna get to you, governor, but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner.  His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:           "
"34","   Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.      You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: ""What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?""  He told you ""IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide.""  And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.      How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?       "
"35","   You don't see it as...         "
"36","   ...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one?         "
"37","   Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...    "
"38","   ...we would've invaded Iraq...    "
"39","   I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.    You finally said, ""No.""    To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brother's war was a mistake?  "
"40","   Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world.  Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?    "
"41","   Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror.  As president, would you bring back water boarding?    "
"42","   We have a lot for you, don't worry.         "
"43","   Fear not, you may rue that request.     "
"44","   Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.    Mr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.    "
"45","   Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.    "
"46","   Now, 15 years ago, uncalled yourself a liberal on health care.  You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.    Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?  "
"47","   But on ObamaCare...    "
"48","   Mr. Trump, hold up one second.    "
"49","   All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul...    "
"50","   OK.    "
"51","   All right, let me...         "
"52","   Mr. Trump, it's not just your past support for single- payer health care.  You've also supported a host of other liberal policies.  Use -- you've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.    You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors.    And you said recently, quote, ""When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.""    "
"53","   So what specifically did...    UNIDENTIFIED "
"54","   -- they do?    "
"55","   Hold on.    We're going to -- we're going to move on.         "
"56","   We'll come back to you, Governor Walker.    "
"57","   We have many questions to come.    "
"58","   Many questions to come.         "
"59","   Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, ""Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?""    Now, broadly...         "
"60","   -- broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.    But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government.  But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen.    In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.    So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?     "
"61","   Dr. Carson...    UNIDENTIFIED "
"62","   Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?      "
"63","   Governor Bush?      "
"64","   We're going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.      Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math.  A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose federal involvement in education.  They say it should all be handled locally.      President Obama's secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, ""fringe group of critics."" Do you think that's accurate?      "
"65","   Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?     "
"66","   And do you agree with your old friend?      "
"67","   We have many more questions coming on a host of topics, here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.  Stay with us.            UNIDENTIFIED "
"68","   We have many more questions coming on a host of topics. Here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.  Stay with us.           UNIDENTIFIED "
"69","   It's just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.  Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls.  And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked.  We hope.           "
"70","       "
"71","   Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.    Yesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant ""death to America"" were quote, ""making common cause with the Republican caucus.""      Here's what two of your opponents on the five p.m. debate stage said about Iran.         "
"72","   Now, I wanna ask a few of you this.  First, Governor Walker.      You've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one.  If this deal is undone, what then?      "
"73","   Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?      "
"74","   Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?      "
"75","   Thank you, gentlemen.      "
"76","   Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out.  Stick around.  Social issues, next.           "
"77","   Senator Rubio, you favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans.  Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous.  He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings.  If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?      "
"78","   You don't favor a rape and incest exception?      "
"79","   Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, ""very pro- choice.""  Even supporting partial-birth abortion.  You favored an assault weapons ban as well.  In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat.  Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets.  When did you actually become a Republican?      "
"80","   Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.      "
"81","   Is it true?      "
"82","   Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.      "
"83","   The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty. Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage?      "
"84","   How would you -- how would you explain it to a child?       "
"85","   Senator Paul, in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on same sex marriage, Carol Fox on Facebook want to know the following.  Quote, what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs?      "
"86","   Governor Walker, many in the Black Live Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overly-aggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time.  Do you agree?  And if so, how do you plan to address it?  And if not, why not?     "
"87","   Thank you.    "
"88","  Welcome back to Cleveland.  Our next topic is foreign policy.  Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.    His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S. troops death in Iraq, and Afghanistan.  His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.    So, Mr.  Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?    "
"89","  Another new development today, Senior Defense officials tell Fox they strongly suspect Russia was behind the cyber attack on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs office...     : ...Please.    "
"90","  ...email.  This comes in the wake of the director of national intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.    Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?    "
"91","  Dr.  Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, ""that's a red line for us,"" and that there would be enormous consequences.    One year later, and with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.    As president, would you have used military force there?     "
"92","   Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?    "
"93","   Governor -- Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing.  Women are moving into combat roles.  Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped.  And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.    As commander in chief, how would you handle that?    "
"94","   Senator Paul, the first budget your proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel.  You have since changed your view on that issue.  What made you change your mind.    "
"95","   OK.  But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?    "
"96","   Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?    "
"97","   Governor, thank you.    "
"98","   Senator, we're going to finish up with some more questions, thank you.    "
"99","   We have to stand you by, because after the break, we're going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and God.    Stay tuned for that.         "
"100","   Welcome back.      In our final moments here together, we're going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts.  But first, we want to ask them an interesting closing question from Chase Norton on Facebook, who wants to know this of the candidates: ""I want to know if any of them have received a word from God on what they should do and take care of first.""    Senator Cruz, start from you.  Any word from God?     "
"101","   Governor Kasich, same question.      "
"102","   Governor Walker, same question.      "
"103","   Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question.  But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans?  I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation's veterans.      So I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.      "
"104","   Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now.  And what, if anything, you can do -- you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.       "
"105","   Now each candidate will make a closing statement.  You'll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this debate. We'll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich.      "
"106","   Governor Christie?      "
"107","   Senator Marco Rubio.      "
"108","   Thank you, Senator.      "
"109","   Senator Ted Cruz.      "
"110","   Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.      "
"111","   Governor Scott Walker.      "
"112","   Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir.      "
"113","   Gentlemen, thank you.      "
"114","   It's over!      "
"115","   That's it.      "
"116","  I'm Jake Tapper. We're live at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for the main event. Round 2 of CNN's presidential debate starts now.   "
"117","  The eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums. They are ready to face off, and if you've been watching this race, you know anything could happen over the next few hours. To viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagan's presidential plane as our backdrop.    "
"118","  This debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world. It's also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network. I know everyone is very eager to get started.  But first, I want to explain the ground rules tonight. My name is Jake Tapper. I'll be the moderator. I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt. He worked in the Reagan administration for six years. And by CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash.  I will ask follow-up questions, I will attempt to guide the discussion. Candidates, I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll give you time to respond if you've been singled out for criticism.  Our viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls.     "
"119","  Our goal for this evening is a debate. A true debate, with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree -- on policy, on politics, on leadership. Now, let's begin.   I'd like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you, Senator Paul.  "
"120","  Senator Cruz?  "
"121","  Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. We're going to get to many of them tonight, but I do want to start off with some current events in the news, and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail. "
"122","  Mrs. Fiorina, I want to start with you. Fellow Republican candidate, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, has suggested that your party's frontrunner, Mr. Donald Trump, would be dangerous as President. He said he wouldn't want, quote, ""such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes."" You, as well, have raised concerns about Mr. Trump's temperament.  You've dismissed him as an entertainer. Would you feel comfortable with Donald trump's finger on the nuclear codes?  "
"123","  You didn't answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? It's an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised.  "
"124","  Mr. Trump?   "
"125","  Mr. -- Senator Paul, your name has been invoked. "
"126","  Mr. Trump?   "
"127","  I want to -- I want to give Mr. Trump... "
"128","  ... Mr. Trump, I want to give you another chance -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left, Governor Bush, said. Governor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees you're not a serious candidate. Tell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief. "
"129","  Governor Bush, would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? "
"130","  Governor Walker?  "
"131","  Let's move on.    "
"132","  A phenomenon going on in the race right now is the political...  OK, Governor Kasich, go ahead.  "
"133","  We have a lot of issues coming up, sir.  "
"134","  We are getting to the issues, sir.    "
"135","  Phenomenon going on in the race is the political outsiders in the race, Dr. Carson, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, all together, have majority support in the polls.  Governor Christie, I want to ask you about something that Dr. Carson said the other day.  Dr. Carson said campaigning is easier for him, because he's not a politician. He can just tell the truth, therefore, while politicians, quote, ""Have their finger in the air to see and do what is politically expedient.""  Governor Christie, tell Dr. Carson, is that a fair description of you?  "
"136","  Well, let's find out. Thank you. "
"137","  Thank you, Governor Christie.  Dr. Carson, who were you thinking about on this stage when you said that?  "
"138","  And more broadly, is experience in government not important for a president to have?  "
"139","  Thank you, Dr. Carson. "
"140","  Thank you.  "
"141","  Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina.    Governor Bush, in addition to the fact that he's an outsider, one of the reasons Mr. Trump is a frontrunner, Republican voters say, is because they like the fact that he is not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the $100 million you've raised for your campaign makes you a puppet for your donors. Are you?  "
"142","  Is there anything else you want to say about this?  "
"143","  Governor -- "
"144","  Sure Dr. Carson.  "
"145","  Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let's move to Russia if we could. Russia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S. enemy, Bashar al-Assad. President Obama's incoming top general says, quote, ""Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security.""  Mr. Trump, you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along, quote, ""very well."" What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria?  "
"146","  So, you -- just to clarify, the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would -- you would reach out to Vladimir Putin, and you would do what? You would...  "
"147","  Senator Rubio, you've taken a very different approach to the -- the question of Russia. You've called Vladimir Putin a, quote, ""gangster.""  Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's?  "
"148","  Thank you, Senator Rubio.     "
"149","  I want to bring in Carly Fiorina.     "
"150","  Ms. Fiorina, you have met...  "
"151","  ...yeah, you've met Vladimir Putin. Yes.  "
"152","  Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  "
"153","  Thank you.  "
"154","  Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  While you're -- while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran, the next president, no matter who he or she may be, will inherit President Obama's Iran deal.  Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one, as you have promised to do, is, quote, ""inexperienced,"" and, quote, ""playing to a crowd."" Respond to Governor Kasich, please.  "
"155","  Why is that not, as Governor Kasich says, playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced?  "
"156","  Governor Kasich... "
"157","  ...Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd? "
"158","  ...Thank you, Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul. TRUMP  chicken... "
"159","  I want to go to Senator Paul. Senator Paul, the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China, President Xi. Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of China's currency manipulation, and because of China's alleged cyber attacks against the United States. Is Governor Walker right? "
"160","  Governor Walker, Senator Paul seemed to suggest...   "
"161","  ...that canceling the state dinner would be rash, and reckless. "
"162","  ...Governor Bush... CRUZ : ...Jake... "
"163","  Governor Bush, your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China. Is Scott Walker's approach the right one, canceling the state dinner? "
"164","  I want to turn... "
"165","  ...I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient. Somebody had to be 11th, and he is, but, I do want to change the subject to the event that you had... "
"166","  ... however you want, but I want to ask this question. "
"167","  All right, sir, go ahead.  "
"168","  OK.  : Jake, I'd like to...  "
"169","  We're going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt, from Salem Radio Network.  "
"170","  Thank you, Senator Paul.    I want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.  "
"171","  That would be fair, you're right. You're the third senator.  "
"172","  We're going to go to Dana Bash...   "
"173","  Senator Cruz? "
"174","  Thank you, Senator. "
"175","  Thank you, Senator. "
"176","  Thank you, Senator. I want to... "
"177","  ... turn back to Governor Huckabee... "
"178","  I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee. Governor Huckabee, last week, you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as I don't need to tell you. You've called what happened to Kim Davis, that clerk, ""an example of the criminalization of Christianity."" There are several people on the stage who disagree with you. Governor Bush, for example, says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity? "
"179","  Thank you, Governor. "
"180","  Well, I'm not telling you that, Governor. But Governor Bush is, because he -- because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law. You disagree? You're not -- you don't... "
"181","  OK. Please do. "
"182","  You did...  "
"183","  Governor, you said, quote, ""she is sworn to uphold the law.""  "
"184","  Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash, who has a question.  "
"185","  Dana, I want to continue on the subject.  Governor Bush, you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood, quote, you're ""not sure we need a half billion for women's health issues."" Now you've since said that you misspoke, you didn't mean to say ""women's health issues."" But Donald Trump said that quote, that comment, which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately, will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney's 47 percent video haunted him.  Tell Donald Trump why he's wrong.  "
"186","  Thank you, Governor Bush.  Donald Trump, let me just... "
"187","  The quote was, ""I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues."" He said he misspoke. You said that that's going to haunt him. Why do you think that? "
"188","  Governor Bush?  "
"189","  I want to -- we're going to get to --  "
"190","  Thank you, Governor.  "
"191","  Thank you, Governor.  "
"192","  We're going to -- we're going to get to many of these issues. This -- we're still in the first block, believe it or not. We're going to get to many of these issues, but before we end this block, Ms. Fiorina, I do want to ask you about this.  In an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you. Quote, ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?"" Mr. Trump later said he was talking about your persona, not your appearance. Please feel free to respond what you think about his persona.    "
"193","  All right. On that note, in less than two minutes -- we're going to take a very quick break. In less than two minutes, the most contentious issue on the campaign trail. And the candidates on the stage are split over how to handle it. That's coming up next.  Please give some applause to the candidates.    "
"194","  Welcome to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration.  Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, ""There are not enough law enforcement officers -- local, county, state and federal combined -- to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people."" Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done. "
"195","  Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview. You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but it's never going to happen. Tell him why you're skeptical of his plans? "
"196","  Thank you, Governor Christie... "
"197","  I want to bring in Dr. Carson because he too has been skeptical of your plan to immediately deport 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants. He said, quote, ""People who say that have no idea what this entails."" Why do you say that, Dr. Carson? "
"198","  ...Dr. Carson... "
"199","  With all due respect, you said about Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, ""People who say that have no idea what this entails."" Why not? "
"200","  ...let's continue the conversation about illegal immigration with Dana Bash. "
"201","  Thank you, Senator Rubio.   "
"202","  Senator Cruz -- Senator Cruz, this week, we learned more about Dr. Carson's plan for the 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country. Dr. Carson proposed giving these undocumented immigrants a six- month grace period to pay back taxes then to let them become guest workers and only to deport people who failed to do that. "
"203","  Well, how would you say it, sir? I was just reading the Wall Street Journal quote, but please tell us. "
"204","  OK, from the horse's mouth, Senator Cruz, does that fit your definition of amnesty? "
"205","  Thank you, Senator. Senator Rubio... "
"206","  ... I'm not sure... "
"207","  We'll come back to you -- we'll come back to you in one second, sir. But Senator Rubio, I'm not sure exactly whose plan he's -- he's saying is -- constitutes amnesty, but I know he has said it about your plan in the past, so I want to give you a chance to respond, then, Dr. Carson, we'll come to you. "
"208","  Thank you, Senator. "
"209","  Thank you, Senator. Senator -- Dr. Carson...   ... I want to give you 30 seconds. I'd like you to answer the question. Senator Cruz describes plans such as yours as amnesty. Why is your plan not amnesty? "
"210","  Thank you, Dr. Carson. I want to talk about the issue of birthright citizenship, which -- which has emerged since the first debate as -- as an a -- a major issue in this campaign.  Mr. Trump, you say that babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrants should not any longer get automatic American citizenship. Ms. Fiorina says that you are pandering on this issue and acting like the politicians that you rail against. What's your message to Ms. Fiorina on birthright citizenship?  "
"211","  Ms. Fiorina, the vast majority of countries do not have birthright citizenship...     "
"212","  ...Donald Trump is right about that. Why is it pandering when he's -- he says this?  "
"213","  Ms. Fiorina...  "
"214","  Please.  "
"215","  Thank you.  "
"216","  Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond...  "
"217","  Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul... "
"218","  Senator Paul, I want to bring you in. Where -- where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?  "
"219","  All right. Senator Paul, thank you so much. Let's turn to a new topic. We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs. We have two CEOs on stage right now.  Ms. Fiorina, you were CEO of Hewlett Packard. Donald Trump says you, quote, ""ran HP into the ground,"" you laid off tens of thousands of people, you got viciously fired.  For voters looking to somebody with private-sector experience to create American jobs, why should they pick you and not Donald Trump?  "
"220","  Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  "
"221","  Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. "
"222","  Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump, why would you be better at creating jobs than Carly Fiorina?  "
"223","  Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you a chance to respond.  "
"224","  Mr. Trump.  "
"225","  Thank you, Mr. Trump.  "
"226","  Governor Christie's name has been invoked. I'd like to give him a 30 second opportunity.  "
"227","  Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you  "
"228","  Governor Kasich, I'm coming to you next, but Ms. Fiorina's name was mentioned, and I have to give her the opportunity to respond if she wants it.  "
"229","  Thank you. "
"230","  Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.  Governor Kasich, I want to come -- I'm coming to you. I'm coming to you. Let me ask the question. You can use the time however you want.  "
"231","  Donald Trump says that the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder by paying a lower tax rate. He wants to raise the taxes of hedge fund managers, as does Governor Bush. Do you agree?  "
"232","  Thank you, Governor.  "
"233","  Thank you, Governor Kasich.  "
"234","  Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in on the question of hedge fund managers and taxing them. You have said that you are bothered by the fact that hedge fund managers pay such a low tax rate and make 2,500 times what people who work for them make.  Do you agree with what Donald Trump and Governor Bush have proposed, raising their tax rates?  "
"235","  Thank you, Governor.  Dr. Carson, you support scrapping the entire tax code and replacing it with a flat tax based on the principal on tithing from the Bible. If you make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes, if you make $10, you pay $1 in taxes.  Donald Trump believes in progressive taxation. He says it's not right that rich people pay the same as the poor. Tell Donald Trump why his ideas on taxes are wrong. "
"236","  Mr. Trump... "
"237","  ...What do you think of the flat tax? Do you think it's fair? "
"238","  Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul? "
"239","  Governor Walker, I want to go to you. Dr. Carson wants to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, you have called it a lame idea. Why is raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame? "
"240","  ...Thank you, Governor... "
"241","  ...Thank you, Governor... "
"242","  Dr. Carson, Governor Walker didn't really answer the question, but I'll let you respond. He called raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame, what do you think of that? "
"243","  Thank you, Dr. Carson... "
"244","  Let me bring in our partner from Salem Radio Network, Hugh Hewitt. "
"245","  Welcome back to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. Let's turn to some issues now in foreign policy.  Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio said it was, quote, ""very concerning to him"" that in a recent interview you didn't seem to know the details about some of the enemies the U.S. faces. Rubio said, if you don't know the answers to those questions, you will not be able to serve as commander-in-chief.  Please respond to Senator Rubio.  "
"246","  Senator Rubio?  "
"247","  Mr. Trump? Senator Rubio seemed to be suggesting that you don't know information that... "
"248","  All right. Senator Rubio.  "
"249","  But are you saying that you have the knowledge to be the president that Mr. Trump does not have?  "
"250","  Mr. Trump?  "
"251","  Senator Rubio, he did invoke your absentee record in the Senate.  "
"252","  Thank you, Senator Rubio. I want to turn now to Hugh Hewitt.  "
"253","  Thank you, Governor. "
"254","  Senator... "
"255","  Senator Paul? "
"256","  Senator Paul... "
"257","  Thank you, Senator Paul... "
"258","  Thank you, Senator Paul...   "
"259","  I understand that Governor Bush's name has been invoked, and then we can go to you, Senator Rubio. "
"260","  Thank you, Governor. "
"261","  Thank you, Governor. Senator Rubio? "
"262","  Thank you, Senator. "
"263","  Dr. Carson? "
"264","  Thank you, Dr. Carson. "
"265","  I mean, it is interesting that you say that, because I want to ask Governor Christie about something else that you have said.  Governor Christie, we just marked the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Now Dr. Carson has said that if he had been president at the time, the United States would not have gone to war in Afghanistan. What does that say to you about how Dr. Carson would respond as president if America were attacked again?  "
"266","  Dr. Carson?  "
"267","  ... Governor Christie.  "
"268","  Dr. Carson?  "
"269","  Thank you, Dr. Carson. "
"270","  Thank you, Dr. Carson.  "
"271","  Thank you, Senator. Governor Huckabee.   "
"272","  Thank you, Governor. "
"273","  Thank you, governor, I want to turn to ISIS. Governor Walker...   "
"274","  Thank you, Governor. Senator Paul, I want to go to you, because you have said that the boots on the ground to fight ISIS need to be Arab boots. We just learned today that despite the Obama administration spending $500 million to help create those Arab boots, there are only four or five U.S. trained fighters in Syria fighting ISIS.  What does that say to you about the effectiveness of the idea of the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots?  "
"275","  Thank you, Senator.   We're going to turn to some domestic issues now. I want to bring in my colleague, Dana Bash.  "
"276","  Sure.... "
"277","  ...Thank you, Governor... "
"278","  ...Thank you, Governor. Dana Bash... "
"279","  Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina... "
"280","  ...Thank you, we're going to turn now to domestic issues with Dana Bash. "
"281","  ...Dana Bash...   "
"282","  Thank you.   "
"283","  Dana Bash? "
"284","  Thank you, Senator. "
"285","  ...Governor Bush... "
"286","  ...I want to let you respond. "
"287","  Thank you, Governor... ...And, that's what we should do, and I hope I'll be working members of the United States Senate to fight hard for the passage of people that have that kind of qualification.  "
"288","  Senator Cruz, 30 seconds.  "
"289","  Thank you, Senator.  "
"290","  Thank you, Semator.  "
"291","  Thank you, Senator.    Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in very quickly if you could. Will you have a litmus test when it comes to appointing Supreme Court nominees?  "
"292","  Thank you, Governor.  "
"293","  Thank you, Governor.  "
"294","  Thank you, Governor. We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, one of the hottest questions that you have been asking us via social media. We will pose it to the candidates. That's coming up right after this.    "
"295","  Welcome back to CNN's Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library here in Simi Valley -- Simi Valley, California.  Many people on social media wanted us to ask about marijuana legalization. Senator Paul, Governor Christie recently said, quote, ""if you're getting high in Colorado today,"" where marijuana has been legalized, ""enjoy it until January 2017, because I will enforce the federal laws against marijuana."" Will you?  "
"296","  I want to give that -- I want to give the person that you called a hypocrite an opportunity to respond. Do you want to identify that person?  "
"297","  Is there somebody you were specifically thinking of?  "
"298","  That's what I though, but I wanted   to say it.  "
"299","  OK.  "
"300","  Governor Bush, please.  "
"301","  I want to go right now -- I want to go right now... "
"302","  That's true. Go ahead, Christie, please.  "
"303","  You may respond, and then I'll bring in you, Ms. Fiorina.    "
"304","  Yes, Senator Paul.    "
"305","  I want to bring in Ms. Fiorina -- I want to bring in Ms. Fiorina on this issue.  "
"306","  Hugh -- Hugh, I'd like to...   "
"307","  I'd like to turn it over -- I'd like to turn to Dana Bush. "
"308","  Thank you, Governor.     "
"309","  I'm coming to you right now on a separate issue, sir. We received...  : Well, I want to talk about this issue for a moment.  "
"310","  We received a lot of questions from social media about climate change.  Senator Rubio, Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, George Shultz, reminds us that when Reagan was president he faced a similar situation to the one that we're facing now. There were dire warnings from the mass consensus of the scientific community about the ozone layer shrinking.  Shultz says Ronald Reagan urged skeptics in industry to come up with a plan. He said, do it as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right. The scientists were right. Reagan and his approach worked.  Secretary Shultz asks, why not take out an insurance policy and approach climate change the Reagan way?  "
"311","  I'm citing George Shultz.  "
"312","  Governor Christie, you have said that climate change is real, and that humans help contribute to it. Without getting into the issue of China versus the United States, which I understand you've talked about before, what do you make of skeptics of climate change such as Senator Rubio?  "
"313","  Just for the record, I was citing Secretary of State George Shultz, Ronald Reagan's secretary of state who I don't think anybody would call him left-wing.  "
"314","  I called you a skeptic.  "
"315","  I want to go another question right now.    "
"316","  Thank you, Governor.     "
"317","  I'm turning to...  "
"318","  ...I'm turning to another -- I'm turning to another issue right now. Senator Cruz. Well, I think we've heard from several this evening.  A backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak here in California. Dr. Carson, Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly linked vaccines, childhood vaccines, to autism, which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.  You're a pediatric neurosurgeon. Should Mr. Trump stop saying this?  "
"319","  Should he stop saying it? Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?  "
"320","  Mr. Trump, as president, you would...  "
"321","  I'm going right to you.  "
"322","  Mr. Trump, as president, you would be in charge of the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, both of which say you are wrong. How would you handle this as president?  "
"323","  Thank you.  "
"324","  Dr. -- Dr. Carson?  "
"325","  Dr. Carson, you just heard his medical take.    "
"326","  Dr. Paul? Dr. Paul, I'd like to bring you in.  "
"327","  Alright, thank you so much...  "
"328","  Coming up -- I'm sorry, Governor Huckabee, please.  "
"329","  Thank you, Governor.  "
"330","  We have to take another quick break. Coming up, Ronald Reagan looming large over this debate. So how Reaganesque exactly are these Republicans? We will find out next.    "
"331","  Welcome back to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. We have a few last questions for you. Two of them a little lighthearted, the other one more serious. We'll start with one of the more light questions. Senator Paul, I'm going to start with you and we're just going to go down the line.  Earlier this year, the Treasury Department announced that a woman will appear on the $10 bill. What woman would you like to see on the $10 bill?  "
"332","  Governor Huckabee?  "
"333","  Senator Paul  . "
"334","  I'm sorry. Senator Rubio?  "
"335","  Just the senators. "
"336","  Senator Cruz?  "
"337","  Dr. Carson?  "
"338","  Mr. Trump. "
"339","  Governor Bush. "
"340","  Governor Walker. "
"341","  Mrs. Fiorina. "
"342","  Governor Kasich. "
"343","  Governor Christie. "
"344","  Alright. Some good entries if anybody at the mint was listening. Here's the next lighthearted question, you all know that the United States Secret Service uses codenames for the president, and his family. Ronald Reagan's codename, for example, was, ""Rawhide"", an homage to his performances in Westerns. Nancy Reagan's was, ""Rainbow"". You don't have to come up the one for your spouse, but, what would you want, Governor Christie, I'll start with you, your Secret Service codename to be.   "
"345","  Governor Walker? "
"346","  Mr. Trump? "
"347","  Dr. Carson? "
"348","  Senator Cruz? "
"349","  Senator Rubio? "
"350","  Governor Huckabee. "
"351","  Senator Paul. "
"352","  That's a mouthful, but OK.   "
"353","  OK, here's the more serious question, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President, used the plane behind you to accomplish a great many things. Perhaps, most notably, to challenge Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall, and ultimately, to make peace with the USSR. How will the world look different once your Air Force One is parked in the hangar of your presidential library? Senator Paul? "
"354","  Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.    "
"355","  Florida Senator Marco Rubio.    "
"356","  Texas Senator Ted Cruz.    "
"357","  Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.    "
"358","  Businesswoman Carly Fiorina.    "
"359","  Ohio Governor John Kasich.    "
"360","  And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.    "
"361","  Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 90 second for each answer. One minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you'll here this.  "
"362","  It sounds like a game show but it's not.  Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room, and I'm not talking about your party's fine symbol. I'm talking about the purpose of tonight's debate.  The economy and what each of you would do to improve it. No more, no less. We are focused on those issues, and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words. That is the agenda tonight. How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow. And so we begin. Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well. They're demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Just a few hours ago, near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.  Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?  DONALD "
"363","  So do not raise the minimum wage?  "
"364","  Dr. Carson, you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery. And this Facebook map show Americans share your concern. The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation, especially here in the state of Wisconsin.  You suggested one minimum wage does not fit all, and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people. Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less. Where are you? DR. BEN "
"365","  So, sir, just to be clear, you would not raise it?  "
"366","  Senator Rubio, you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways, including free health care, free college and a host of other government-paid benefits. Since you aren't a fan of all they're giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.  SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. As I've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. We call that the American dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people.  What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn't. In the 20th century, it's a disaster.  If you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.  Here's the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.    If we do that -- and if we do this -- if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.  "
"367","  Thank you, Senator Rubio.    "
"368","  We've asked people on Facebook to submit their questions for the candidates. Seth Bell wrote, ""We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?"" Governor Kasich, you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton. Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably. Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years. Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency. With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?  GOV. JOHN KASICH, "
"369","  Did you want to name any specific steps, sir?  "
"370","  Thank you, sir. "
"371","  Senator Cruz, the International Monetary Fund recently cut its expectations for economic growth. Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing. The next president will have to deal with it. You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion. You're calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax. What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs?  SEN. TED CRUZ, "
"372","  Thank you, sir.  "
"373","  Governor Bush...  "
"374","  We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich, coming up. We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich. "
"375","  We will -- we will certainly get to that. Governor Bush?  "
"376","  Almost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking. Many have given up. That's what the participation rate tells us. You've said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth, which we haven't seen since the year 2000. What specific regulations would you change? And how will that lead to jobs and growth?  "
"377","  Thank you, sir.  "
"378","  Ms. Fiorina, while you've all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president's jobs performance.  Now, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month. Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month. Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month. If you win the nomination, you'll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?  CARLY "
"379","  Thank you. Thank you. Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States. Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers. Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker. Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?  SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: Absolutely. And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst. It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of...   "
"380","  Thank you, Senator.  "
"381","  All right. We're only just getting started. Coming up, your taxes. Stick around. You're watching FOX Business   "
"382","  Welcome back to the Milwaukee Theater and the Republican presidential debate. Let's get right back to our questions.  Dr. Carson, to you. You recently railed against the double- standard in the media, sir, that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to then-Senator Barack Obama's. Still, as a candidate whose brand has always been trust, are you worried your campaign -- which you've always said, sir, is bigger than you -- is now being hurt by you?  "
"383","  I'll just forget that follow-up there.    "
"384","  Thank you, Dr. Carson.  "
"385","  Mr. Trump, a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration's plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally. The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court.  At the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy, what will you do about it?  "
"386","  Can we just send 5 million people back with no effect on economy?  "
"387","  So what will you do? "
"388","  Thank you, sir.  "
"389","  Senator Rubio...  "
"390","  Yes, one quick comment, yes.  "
"391","  Governor Bush... "
"392","  Governor -- Governor, you... "
"393","  You should let Jeb speak.   : We have grown -- we have grown... "
"394","  Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you yourself -- you yourself said let Governor Bush speak. Governor Bush? "
"395","  Senator Rubio? Senator... "
"396","  Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me -- let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country. The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology. Americans are anxious that the new economy isn't producing higher-paying jobs. Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.  Meanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away. How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?  "
"397","  Thank you. Senator Cruz -- Senator Cruz, entitlements. You've argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group...   "
"398","  ...reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff. What's going to be different this time? "
"399","  ...I said for future retirees was your statement...   "
"400","  We go back to Facebook. Dewayne Wesley Cato asks on Facebook, how do we get rid of regulations choking our businesses? Ms. Fiorina? Specifically, under the president's Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance, or be fined. Many are opting to pay the fine. Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether. What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business? "
"401","  Just to be clear, you want to repeal Obamacare...   "
"402","  ...but, what's the alternative? "
"403","  Just to be clear, you say you would repeal Obamacare... "
"404","  ...But, what is the alternative... "
"405","  ...and how does that help small business... "
"406","  ...Thank you... "
"407","  Alright, thank you. We're going to take a break here. Coming up, a big issue many Americans are facing, taxes. The Republican Presidential Debate continues now, live, from Milwaukee.   "
"408","  Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee. Let's get back to the questions. And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year, taxes. And this will go to several of you.  One of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes. Facebook data certainly backs that up. Once again the green on this map that we're going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation, especially here in Wisconsin.  First off, Dr. Carson, to you. You say you are in favor of a tax system, I guess akin to tithing, sir, with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said, if everybody pays this, I think God is a pretty fair guy, so tithing is a pretty fair process.  But Donald Trump says that is not fair. That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it's a fair thing to do. So whose plan would God endorse then, Doctor?     Yours or Mr. Trump's?  "
"409","  Right.  "
"410","  Thank you very much.  Senator Paul, you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an across-the-board 14.5 percent fair and flat tax. You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that's the idea. You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.  But don't you risk, sir, creating a near-term budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning? "
"411","  There are no deductions on your -- under your plan?  "
"412","  Thank you, Senator.  "
"413","  Senator Cruz, there isn't anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes. Most people just want a fair shake, and they don't want their money to be wasted.  But explain how your plan works. How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits?  "
"414","  But you haven't told us how to pay for it.  "
"415","  Thank you, Senator.     Governor Bush, Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration. But, Governor Bush, how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda? Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency? "
"416","  The -- the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published -- were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and these -- the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent. Which -- are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated? "
"417","  There was a separate -- separate...    "
"418","  That's right. That's right. "
"419","  But isn't that -- isn't that part of the problem? When I say, Senator, that if -- if this deal is not ratified by -- by the U.S. -- by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it's been seeking to do? And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead? "
"420","  Thank you. Thanks, Senator.  "
"421","  Coming up, the biggest threats facing the next commander-in-chief. You're watching the Republican presidential debate, live tonight from Milwaukee. We'll be right back.   "
"422","  Welcome back. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. The candidates taking the questions you want answered. Also tonight, you can see what America is saying about the debate. Go to Facebook and type #gopdebate into the search box.  Now, back to the questions. Americans face security threats at home and abroad. Last year, terrorist attacks rose 61 percent, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, with the most deaths occurring in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria.  Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president's decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?  "
"423","  We asked Facebook to take a look at some of the major issues we're talking about, and tackling in this debate tonight. This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most. The bigger the word, the more the talk. One of the most discussed issues in the last month, homeland security. Governor Bush, what is the biggest threat facing America today? "
"424","  Thank you, sir. Mr. Trump, in 2012 debate, President Obama mocked Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the top geopolitical challenge facing the United States, saying he was a Cold War dinosaur. Now, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and has put troops in Syria. You have said you will have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. So, what does President Trump do in response to Russia's aggression? "
"425","  Thank you, sir. "
"426","  Senator Paul...   "
"427","  Senator Paul, you have already said, sir, that that would be a mistake in not talking to Vladimir Putin, or to rule it out. You've argued that it's never a good idea to close down communication. With that in mind, do you think the same applies to administration efforts right now to include the Iranians in talks on Syria? "
"428","  ...Well, then how would you respond? "
"429","  But if you're not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?  "
"430","  Thank you, Senator.  Governor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet state-backed Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion. And as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Would you stop them?  "
"431","  Thank you, Governor. Plenty of opportunities. Thank you.  Neil? "
"432","  All right. And look at the time, look at the time. You are watching FOX Business, we'll take a break. Stick around.     "
"433","  Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee. Now let's get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.  Governor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn't bail out the banks. Would you? "
"434","  But, Governor, but can I just quickly -- did -- you can't seriously guarantee that there won't be another financial crisis, can you?  "
"435","  Ever? There will never be another financial crisis? "
"436","  Dr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever. Asset held by JPMorgan Chase, for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion. Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up? "
"437","  But just to be clear, just -- just to be clear, then, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't favor breaking up the big banks? You think they're big enough -- they're OK as they are, as big as they are? "
"438","  Thank you, Dr. Carson. "
"439","  Thank you.  "
"440","  Senator Cruz -- and I will get to you -- but, Senator Cruz, on that theme, Facebook data shows that over the last month alone, nearly 1 million people -- nearly 1 million -- have been concerned about reining in Wall Street, apparently believing that some have not been punished enough.  So, as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general, would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored, in other words, the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder? "
"441","  Senator...   "
"442","  Senator, I really want to be clear here. Are you saying, sir, that if Bank of America were on the brink, you would let it fail? "
"443","  Sir, I understand that. I just want to be clear, if you don't mind, that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision. And I just want to be clear. If it were to happen again, for whatever the reason, you would let it go, you would let a Bank of America go? "
"444","  Thank you, governor.  "
"445","  Senator Rubio. "
"446","  Thank you, Governor Kasich.  "
"447","  More questions -- more questions coming up, when the Republican presidential debate comes right back, live from Milwaukee. Stay with us.     "
"448","  Welcome back to the fourth Republican presidential debate.  Senator Rubio, Hillary Clinton is the clear front runner for the Democratic nomination. If she is indeed the nominee, you will be facing a candidate with an impressive resume.  She was the first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state under Barack Obama. She has arguably more experience, certainly more time in government than almost all of you on stage tonight.  Why should the American people trust you to lead this country, even though she has been so much closer to the office?  "
"449","  OK, I think it's fair to say you're not fans of Hillary Clinton's resume. Alright, Mr. Trump.... "
"450","  I had a feeling. Perhaps the most successful capitalist on this stage tonight, you've acknowledged that some give capitalism a bad name. You've been particularly critical of businesses that find all sorts of ways of paying their taxes by keeping money abroad, but your own plan includes an incentive to bring -- that more the $2 trillion dollars home. Isn't that, like, a one-time bounty... "
"451","  ...Some of the guys you all but call pirates, so they still keep the loot, and pay only a price to bring it back. "
"452","  Senator Paul, you were one of 15 republicans to vote for an amendment which states that human activity contributed to climate change. President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions. At the same time, energy production in America has boomed. Is it possible to continue this boom, and move toward energy self-sufficiency, while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate change program? "
"453","  ...Alright, gentlemen, I know you want to -- and I want to, be we also promised to get people home tonight, and we are going to take a quick break here. I think it is fair to say at this juncture that you can discuss these issues, and only business issues, but still keep it interesting. Stick around for these candidates closing statements.   "
"454","  Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. And now, candidates, it's time for your closing statements. You get 30 seconds each, and, Senator Paul, we will begin with you. "
"455","  Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich?  "
"456","  Carly Fiorina?  "
"457","  Former Governor Jeb Bush? "
"458","  Senator Ted Cruz?  "
"459","  Senator Marco Rubio? "
"460","  He's funny.  "
"461","  Dr. Ben Carson? "
"462","  Donald Trump?  "
"463","  Candidates, we want to thank you all. We also appreciate your helping save time by talking over one another at times. That was welcomed. But by all means, it was a very riveting debate. Business issues can be -- can be riveting, because it wasn't about us, it's about them.  "
"464","  Thank you.  "
