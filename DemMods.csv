"1","  Good evening, I'm John Dickerson of CBS News in Des Moines, Iowa.  The debate you've tuned in to see tonight is a symbol of the freedom we all cherish.  Last night the world watched in horror as freedom was savagely attacked in the heart of Paris.  At least 129 people were killed and many more wounded in a coordinated series of terror attacks.  Tonight, as France mourns, so does America. So before we begin tonight's second debate with these candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination we ask you to join us in observing a moment of silence.    MARTIN O'"
"2","  Before we-- before we start the debate here are the rules.  The candidates have one minute to respond to our questions and 30 seconds to respond to our follow-up.  Any candidate who is attacked by another candidate gets 30 seconds for rebuttal.  Here's how we'll keep time, after a question is asked the green light goes on.  When there are 15 seconds left the candidate gets a yellow warning light.  And when time's up the light turns red.  That means stop talking.    Those are the rules.  So let's get started.  You will each have one minute for an opening statement to share your thoughts about the attacks in your Paris and lay out your visions for America.  First, Senator Sanders. BERNIE "
"3","  All right, Senator Sanders.  Secretary Clinton. HILLARY "
"4","  Governor O'Malley. MARTIN O'"
"5","  All right, thank you, governor, thank all of you.  The terror attacks last night underscored the biggest challenge facing the next President of the United States.  At a time of crisis the country and the world look to the president for leadership and for answers.  So Secretary Clinton, I'd like to start with you, hours before the attacks, President Obama said, ""I don't think ISIS is gaining strength.""  72% of Americans think the fight against ISIS is going badly.  Won't the legacy of this administration which is-- which you were a part of-- won't that legacy be that it underestimated the threats from ISIS? HILLARY "
"6","  But-- Secretary Cli-- Clinton, the question's about what-- was ISIS underestimated.  And I'll-- I'll just ask-- the president referred to ISIS as the JVU in a speech, the council in foreign relations in June of 2014 said, ""I could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq.""  So you've got prescriptions for the future.  But how-- how do we know if those prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past? HILLARY "
"7","  Okay, Governor O'Malley would you critique the administration's response to ISIS?  If the United States doesn't lead  ? MARTIN O'"
"8","  Senator Sanders, you said you wanna rid the planet of ISIS.  In the previous date you said the greatest threat to national security was climate change.  Do you still believe that? BERNIE "
"9","  Quickly just-- let me ask you-- follow up on that, Senator Sanders, when you said the disastrous vote   BERNIE "
"10","  All right, let's let Secretary Clinton respond to that. HILLARY "
"11","  Senator Sanders, let me just follow this line of thinking.  You've criticized then Senator Clinton's vote.  Do you have anything to criticize in the way she performed as secretary of state? BERNIE "
"12","  All right. BERNIE "
"13","  Here, let me go-- MARTIN O'"
"14","  All right, Secretary. HILLARY "
"15","  I understand.  Quickly, Senator. BERNIE "
"16","  Let me ask you-- Secretary Clinton a question about leadership.  We're asking about what role does America pick.  Let me ask you about Libya.  So Libya is a country in which ISIS has-- taken hold in part because of the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi, that was an operation you championed.  President Obama says is the lesson he took from that operation.  In an interview he said, ""The lesson was do we have an answer for the day after.""   JOHN "
"17","  20:19:51:00  --supposed to be one of the lessons that we learned after the Iraq war?  And how did you get it wrong with Libya if the key lesson of the Iraq war is have a plan for after? HILLARY "
"18","  Governor O'Malley, I wanna ask you a question and you can add whatever you'd like to.  But let me ask you, is the world too dangerous a place for a governor who has no foreign policy experience? MARTIN O'"
"19","  Secretary Clinton, you mentioned radical jihadists. HILLARY "
"20","  Marco Rubio, also running for president, said that this attack showed-- in-- the attack in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam.  Do you agree with that characterization, radical Islam? HILLARY "
"21","  Just to interrupt, he-- he didn't say all Muslims.  He just said radical Islam.  Is that a phrase you don't-- HILLARY "
"22","  The reason I ask is that you gave a speech at Georgetown University in which you said that it was important to show-- quote-- respect even for one's enemy.  Trying to understand and in so far as psychologically possible empathize with their perspective and point of view.  Can you explain what that means in the context of this kind of barbarism? HILLARY "
"23","  Very quickly, do either of you-- radical Islam, do either of you use that--   JOHN "
"24","  phrase? BERNIE "
"25","  Governor O'Malley, you've been making the case-- when you talk about lack of forward vision, you're essentially saying that Secretary Clinton lacks that vision.  And this critique matches up with this discussion of language.  The critique is that the softness of language betrays a softness of approach.  So if this language-- if you don't call it by what it is, how can your approach be effective to the cause.  That's the critique. MARTIN O'"
"26","  Secretary Clinton, the-- French president has called this attack an act of war.  A couple of days ago you were asked if you would declare war on ISIS and you said no.  Would you-- would you-- what would you say now? HILLARY "
"27","  And you think that covers all of it? HILLARY "
"28","  20:28:20:00  If you were in the Senate-- if you were in the Senate would you be okay with-- the commander in chief doing that without coming back to you? HILLARY "
"29","  Let me just-- let that is-- whatever you've got to say refugees.  You've been a little vague about what you've done in the Syrian refugees.   JOHN "
"30","  I mean, what's your view on them now-- BERNIE "
"31","  Governor O'Malley, you have a magic number.  I think it's 65,000.  Does that number go up or down based on what happened yesterday? MARTIN O'"
"32","  Just very quickly, 65,000, the number stays? MARTIN O'"
"33","  But-- what would you want? MARTIN O'"
"34","  Secretary Clinton, let me ask you a question from Twitter that's come in.  And this is a question on this issue of-- of refugees.  The question is with the U.S. preparing to absorb Syrian refugees, how do you propose we screen those coming in to keep our citizens safe? HILLARY "
"35","  Senator Sanders, I'm sorry, we're gonna have to take a break now.  We will have more of the Democratic debate here from Drake University in Des Moines,   Iowa.  JOHN "
"36","  Wanna turn now from terrorism to another important issue for many Americans, the financial squeeze on the middle class.  For that, we go to my CBS News colleague, Nancy Cordes.  Nancy? NANCY "
"37","  Governor. MARTIN O'"
"38","  Governor, you're breaking the rules.   JOHN "
"39","  I'm sorry, we're gonna have to cut for a commercial.  We'll be right back here from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. MARTIN O'"
"40","  There's a lot of presidential history here in Iowa.  It holds the first in the nation Caucasus.  Herbert Hoover was born in West Branch.  And tonight we're in Pope County for our 11th president with three people who hope to be number 45.  Joining me now to question them are Iowan Keven Cooney of KCCI and Kathie Obradovich of the Decides Moines Register, Kevin. KEVIN "
"41","  Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, CBS--   This country will rid our planet of ISIS. HILLARY "
"42","  Good evening again as we begin the second half of the debate.  And joining me in the questioning are-- candidates, our CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, Kevin Cooney of CBS Good Morning affiliate KCCI and Kathie Obradovich of the Des Moines Register. As those who watched the first hour now our topic is Wall Street for those just joining us, welcome.  Senator-- excuse me, Secretary Clinton this time, went to the past there for a moment, Senator Sanders recently said quote, ""People should be suspect of candidates who receive large sums of money from Wall Street and then go out and say, ""Trust me, I'm going to reregulate Wall Street.""  So you've received millions of dollars in contributions and speaking fees from Wall Street companies.  How do you convince voters that you're gonna level the playing field when you're indebted to some of the biggest players? HILLARY "
"43","  Senator Sanders, you've-- you've said that the donations to Secretary Clinton are compromising.  So what did you think of her answer? BERNIE "
"44","  Quick follow-up because you-- you--   Secretary Clinton, you'll get a chance to respond.  You said they know what they're going to get.  What are they gonna get? BERNIE "
"45","  Secretary Clinton gets to respond. HILLARY "
"46","  Hold on, hold on, he was attacked.  Go--   BERNIE "
"47","  Senator, we have to get Senator O'Malley in.  But no-- along with your answer how many Wall Street-- veterans would you have in your administration? MARTIN O'"
"48","  All right, I wanna get to the-- bridge to the issues of guns here.  Secretary Clinton, you've said that Senator Sanders is not tough enough on guns.  But basically he now supports roughly the same things you do.  So can you tell us some of the exact differences going forward between the two of you on the issue of gun control? HILLARY "
"49","  Secretary Clinton just a quick follow up, you say that-- Senator Sanders took a vote that-- on immunity that you don't like.  So if he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future-- opinions by him on this issue, why then is he right when he says you're wrong vote on Iraq tattoos you for offering your judgment? HILLARY "
"50","  Senator, a mistake or not, you're-- you're-- so quickly before-- BERNIE "
"51","  Not a mistake. MARTIN O'"
"52","  Hold on. BERNIE "
"53","  Sorry, I'm gonna bring in Nancy Cordes with a question from Twitter about this exchange.   NANCY "
"54","  That's-- a final word-- the final word, Governor O'Malley, before we go to commercial. MARTIN O'"
"55","  We have to-- we have to go for a commercial, I'm sorry.  We have to go for a commercial here.  We'll be right back with the democratic debate here in Des Moines, Iowa on CBS.   JOHN "
"56","  Back now in Des Moines with the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Senator Sanders, I wanna start with you.  Let's say you're elected president.  Congratulations. BERNIE "
"57","  You've said you'll have a revolution. BERNIE "
"58","  But there's a conservative revolution going on in America right now.  As John Boehner knows, and as Democrats know who have lost in state Houses across the country-- BERNIE "
"59","  --those conservatives are watching tonight and probably shaking their heads.  So   how you deal with that part of the country?  The revolution's already happening, but on the other side. BERNIE "
"60","  Senator, a 30-second follow-up.  We've heard already tonight that-- that your 92% of support for background checks.  Let the ar-- let's look at that as-- as an example.  If there were something 92% of the public was for, there have been these-- these mass shootings, there was emotional support behind it. BERNIE "
"61","  Bipartisan support. BERNIE "
"62","  The president, the full force of his office. BERNIE "
"63","  It went nowhere.  That's the model you're talking about-- nothing happened. BERNIE "
"64","  A ques-- a question from Kathie Obradovich. KATHIE "
"65","  Secretary Clinton, just one-- more question on the email question.  For Democrats, there's an F.B.I. investigation going on.  Can you satisfy Democrats who might worry about another shoe dropping?  That you and your staff have been totally truthful to them and that another shoe is not gonna drop? HILLARY "
"66","  What-- HILLARY "
"67","  Another-- well, race relations is another issue everyone cares about.  And we're gonna switch to that now.  Governor O'Malley, let me ask you a question.  The-- the head of the F.B.I. recently said, ""It might be possible that some police forces are not enforcing the law because they're worried about being caught on camera.""  The acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration said a similar thing.  Where-- where are you on this question and what would you do if you were president and two top members of your administration were floating that idea? MARTIN O'"
"68","  All right, governor.  Sen--   se-- Senator Sanders, one of your former colleagues, an African American member of Congress said to me recently that a young African American man had asked him where to find hope in life.  And he said, ""I just don't know what to tell him about being young and black in America today.""  What would you tell that young African American man? BERNIE "
"69","  Secretary-- Clinton, you told some Black Lives Matter activists recently that there's a difference between rhetoric and activism and what you were trying to do, which is-- was enforce law-- or get laws passed that would help what they-- were pushing for.  But-- recently at the University of Missouri, that activism was very, very effective.  So would you suggest that kind of activism take place at other universities across the country? HILLARY "
"70","  All right.  Over to Kevin Cooney.    KEVIN "
"71","  Governor O'Malley, jump in, yeah. MARTIN O'"
"72","  All right, Nancy Cordes has a question. NANCY "
"73","  Thirty seconds-- BERNIE "
"74","  I'm sorry, I'm sorry governor.  We've got to take a break or the machine breaks down.    Begin the final segment of this debate with something none of you saw coming.  Something quite unexpected.  Soon after your inauguration, you will face a crisis.  All presidents do.  What crisis have you experienced in your life that suggest you've been tested and can face that inevitable challenge?  Secretary Clinton, you first. HILLARY "
"75","  Yeah.  Governor O'Malley, what crisis proves that you're tested? MARTIN O'"
"76","  Senator Sanders, what   experience could you draw on in a crisis-- BERNIE "
"77","  All right, Senator Sanders.  We end--   we've ended the evening on crisis, which underscores and reminds us again of what happened last night.  Now let's move to closing statements, Governor O'Malley? MARTIN O'"
"78","  Secretary-- Secretary Clinton? HILLARY "
"79","  All right, back with some final thoughts in a moment.    And as the candidates are thanking each other for a good debate, Clinton, Sanders, and O'Malley now have two debates in the books, so four more to come.  So, Major Garrett, how did they do tonight and what's getting the most talked about on Twitter?  Major Garrett is with us in this finale. MAJOR "
