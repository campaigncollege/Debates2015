"2","Mods:</p><p>Good evening, I'm John Dickerson of CBS News in Des Moines, Iowa.  The debate you've tuned in to see tonight is a symbol of the freedom we all cherish.  Last night the world watched in horror as freedom was savagely attacked in the heart of Paris.  At least 129 people were killed and many more wounded in a coordinated series of terror attacks.  Tonight, as France mourns, so does America.</p><p>So before we begin tonight's second debate with these candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination we ask you to join us in observing a moment of silence.  (LONG PAUSE) Now please welcome to Drake University Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, (CHEERING) (UNINTEL), Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  (CHEERING) and-- and Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland.  (CHEERING)</p><p>Joining me in the questioning tonight are CBS News congressional correspondent, Nancy Cordes, anchor Kevin Cooney of our CBS Des Moines affiliate, KCCI and political columnist, Kathie Obradovich of The Des Moines Register.  (APPLAUSE) Twitter is another of our partners for this debate.  Tweets will help us follow the reactions to what the candidates say.  So please send us your comments using the hashtag DemDebate.  And we'll begin in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL NOT TRANSCRIBED)</p><p>MARTIN O'"

"4","CLINTON:</p><p>I am a real person with all the pluses and minuses that go along with that.</p><p>BERNIE "
"5","SANDERS:</p><p>(UNINTEL) your own hardware</p><p>HILLARY "
"6","CLINTON:</p><p>I'm running for (UNINTEL).</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"7","MALLEY:</p><p> The American people are sick and tired of hearing about the damn unit (?).  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>HILLARY "
"8","CLINTON:</p><p>We are dead wrong for 21st century America.  We're going forward, we're not going back.</p><p>JOHN "
"9","Mods:</p><p>Before we-- before we start the debate here are the rules.  The candidates have one minute to respond to our questions and 30 seconds to respond to our follow-up.  Any candidate who is attacked by another candidate gets 30 seconds for rebuttal.  Here's how we'll keep time, after a question is asked the green light goes on.  When there are 15 seconds left the candidate gets a yellow warning light.</p><p> And when time's up the light turns red.  That means stop talking.  (LAUGHTER) Those are the rules.  So let's get started.  You will each have one minute for an opening statement to share your thoughts about the attacks in your Paris and lay out your visions for America.  First, Senator Sanders.</p><p>BERNIE "
"10","SANDERS:</p><p>Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.  Together, leading the world this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.  I'm running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people.  And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.</p><p>People are working longer hours for lower wages.  And (UNINTEL) income and wealth goes to the top 1%.  And then on top of that we got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are (UNINTEL) use some of the money into super packs heavily influencing the political process.  What my campaign is about is a political revolution.  Millions of people standing up and saying, ""Enough is enough.  Our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billionaires.""</p><p>JOHN "
"11","Mods:</p><p>All right, Senator Sanders.  Secretary Clinton.</p><p>HILLARY "
"12","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight.  But that is not enough.  We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, the barbaric, ruthless, violence jihadist, terrorist group.</p><p>This election is not only about electing a president.  It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.  And I will be laying out in detail what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.  Our country deserves no rest because all of the other issues we wanna deal with depends on us being secure and strong.</p><p>JOHN "
"13","Mods:</p><p>Governor O'Malley.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"14","MALLEY:</p><p>My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country-- my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss, parents and-- and-- and sons and daughters and family members.  And-- as our hearts go out and as our prayers go out to them we must remember this, that this isn't a new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict of warfare in the 21st century.</p><p>And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.  We must be able to work collaboratively with others.  We must anticipate these threats before they happen.  This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.  As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.  We have a lot of work to do to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.</p><p>JOHN "
"15","Mods:</p><p>All right, thank you, governor, thank all of you.  The terror attacks last night underscored the biggest challenge facing the next President of the United States.  At a time of crisis the country and the world look to the president for leadership and for answers.  So Secretary Clinton, I'd like to start with you, hours before the attacks, President Obama said, ""I don't think ISIS is gaining strength.""  72% of Americans think the fight against ISIS is going badly.  Won't the legacy of this administration which is-- which you were a part of-- won't that legacy be that it underestimated the threats from ISIS?</p><p>HILLARY "
"16","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, John I think that-- we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.  It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.  There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more-- open and cooperative way-- that we can bring people together.</p><p>But it cannot be an American fight.  And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.  That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs so that we can be supportive.  But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.</p><p>JOHN "
"17","Mods:</p><p>But-- Secretary Cli-- Clinton, the question's about what-- was ISIS underestimated.  And I'll-- I'll just ask-- the president referred to ISIS as the JVU in a speech, the council in foreign relations in June of 2014 said, ""I could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq.""  So you've got prescriptions for the future.  But how-- how do we know if those prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past?</p><p>HILLARY "
"18","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush-- made with the Iraqis to leave-- by 2011 is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.  Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.</p><p>And then with the revolution against Assad-- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be-- extremist groups filling the vacuum.</p><p>So, yes, this has developed.  I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition-- to what's happened in the region.  But I don't think that the United States-- has the bulk of the responsibility.  I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.</p><p>JOHN "
"19","Mods:</p><p>Okay, Governor O'Malley would you critique the administration's response to ISIS?  If the United States doesn't lead (UNINTEL)?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"20","MALLEY:</p><p>John, I would-- I would disagree with-- with Secretary Clinton, respectfully, on this score.  This actually is America's fight.  It cannot solely be America's fight.  America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.  America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.</p><p>And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.  ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.  ISIS is now attacked the western democracy in-- in France.  And we do have a role in this.  Not solely ours.  But we must work collaboratively with other nations.  The great failing of these last ten or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.  Our world in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.  Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope, make ourselves stronger at home.</p><p>But also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.  We took out the save haven in Afghanistan but now there is undoubtedly a larger safe haven.  And we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it.  And invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.</p><p>JOHN "
"21","Mods:</p><p>Senator Sanders, you said you wanna rid the planet of ISIS.  In the previous date you said the greatest threat to national security was climate change.  Do you still believe that?</p><p>BERNIE "
"22","SANDERS:</p><p>Absolutely.  In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.  And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say you're gonna see countries all over the world-- this is what the C.I.A. says, they're gonna be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops.  And you're gonna see all kinds of international conflict.</p><p>But of course international terrorism is a major issue that we've got to address today.  And I agree with much of what-- the secretary and-- and the governor have said.  Only have one area of-- of disagreement with the secretary.  I think she said something like,  ""The bulk of the responsibility is not ours.""</p><p>Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely.  And led to the rise of Al Qaeda-- and to-- ISIS.  Now, in fact, what we have got to do-- and I think there is widespread agreement here-- 'cause the United States cannot do it alone.  What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes-- very significantly-- (UNINTEL) nations in that region are gonna have to fight and defend their way of life.</p><p>JOHN "
"23","Mods:</p><p>Quickly just-- let me ask you-- follow up on that, Senator Sanders, when you said the disastrous vote (?) on Iraq-- let's just be clear about what you're saying, you're saying Secretary Clinton-- who was then Senator Clinton-- voted for the Iraq war.  And are you making a direct link between her vote for that or-- and what's happening now for ISIS?  Just so everybody--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"24","SANDERS:</p><p>Oh I don't think any-- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"25","SANDERS:</p><p>I think that was one of the worst foreign policy plunders in the modern history of United States.</p><p>JOHN "
"26","Mods:</p><p>All right, let's let Secretary Clinton respond to that.</p><p>HILLARY "
"27","CLINTON:</p><p>Thank you, John, well, I think it's important we put this in historic context.  United States has unfortunately been victimized by terrorism going back decades.  In the 1980s it was in Beirut, Lebanon under President Reagan's administration and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel and others were-- murdered.</p><p>We also had attacks on two of our embassies in-- Tanzania and Kenya-- when my husband was president.  Again, Americans murdered.  And then of course 9/11 happened which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.  I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.  But I think if we're ever gonna really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism we need to understand it and realize that it had-- ans-- and (UNINTEL) to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.</p><p>JOHN "
"28","Mods:</p><p>Senator Sanders, let me just follow this line of thinking.  You've criticized then Senator Clinton's vote.  Do you have anything to criticize in the way she performed as secretary of state?</p><p>BERNIE "
"29","SANDERS:</p><p>I think we have a disagreement.  And-- the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq, if you look at history, John, you will find that regime change-- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile or whether it was overthrowing the government Guatemala way back when-- these invasions, these-- these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.  I would say that on this issue I'm a little bit more conservative than the secretary.</p><p>JOHN "
"30","Mods:</p><p>All right.</p><p>BERNIE "
"31","SANDERS:</p><p>And that I am not a great fan of regime changes.</p><p>JOHN "
"32","Mods:</p><p>Here, let me go--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"33","MALLEY:</p><p>John, may I-- may I interject here?  Secretary Clinton also said that we left the h-- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake, and indeed it was.  But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.</p><p>It was also the disbanding of-- many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.  It was-- country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.  We need to be much more far f-- thinking in this new 21st century era of-- of nation state failures and conflict.  It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.  It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.</p><p>JOHN "
"34","Mods:</p><p>All right, Secretary.</p><p>HILLARY "
"35","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, and-- and of course each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.  Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung onto power-- with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of-- Hezbollah-- being there basically fighting his battles.</p><p>So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.  This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.  It's become more complicated.  And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.  The Shia-- Sunni split, the dictatorships that have suppressed people's aspirations, the increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.  We saw that in Egypt.  We saw a dictator overthrown, we saw Muslim Brotherhood president installed and then we saw him ousted and the army back.  So I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no places more so than in the Middle East.</p><p>JOHN "
"36","Mods:</p><p>I understand.  Quickly, Senator.</p><p>BERNIE "
"37","SANDERS:</p><p>The-- the secretary's obviously right.  It is enormously complicated.  But here's something that I believe we have to do is we put together an international coalition.  And that is we have to understand that the Muslim nation in the region, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, all of these nations, they're gonna just have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.</p><p>They are gonna have to take on ISIS.  This is a war for the soul of Islam.  And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are gonna have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.  We should be supportive of that effort.  So should the UK, so should France.  But those Muslim countries are gonna have to lead the efforts.  They are not doing it now.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>HILLARY "
"38","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, I think--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>HILLARY "
"39","CLINTON:</p><p>I-- I think that is very unfair to a few that you mentioned-- most particularly Jordan which has put a lot on the line to the United States.  It's also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria and has been therefore subjected to threats and attacks-- by extremists themselves.</p><p>I do agree that in particular Turkey and the Gulf Nations have got to make up their minds.  Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?  And there are many ways of doing it.  They can provide sources, they can provide resources.  But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.</p><p>JOHN "
"40","Mods:</p><p>Let me ask you-- Secretary Clinton a question about leadership.  We're asking about what role does America pick.  Let me ask you about Libya.  So Libya is a country in which ISIS has-- taken hold in part because of the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi, that was an operation you championed.  President Obama says is the lesson he took from that operation.  In an interview he said, ""The lesson was do we have an answer for the day after.""</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"41","Mods:</p><p>20:19:51:00  --supposed to be one of the lessons that we learned after the Iraq war?  And how did you get it wrong with Libya if the key lesson of the Iraq war is have a plan for after?</p><p>HILLARY "
"42","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, we did have a plan.  And I think it's-- fair to say that-- of all of the Arab leaders Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.  And when he moved on his own people threatening-- a mass occurred, genocide-- the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners-- did ask for American help.  And we provided it.  And we didn't put a single boot on the ground.  And-- Gaddafi was deposed.</p><p>The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful Arab elections that any Arab country has had.  They elected moderate leaders.  Now there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.  And it is imperative that we do more-- not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland-- but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.</p><p>JOHN "
"43","Mods:</p><p>Governor O'Malley, I wanna ask you a question and you can add whatever you'd like to.  But let me ask you, is the world too dangerous a place for a governor who has no foreign policy experience?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"44","MALLEY:</p><p>John, the world is a very dangerous place.  But the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.  I mean, let's talk about this arc of-- of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.</p><p>Libya is now a mess.  Syria is a mess.  Iraq is a mess.  Afghanistan is a mess.  As Americans we have shown ourselves-- to have the greatest military on the face of the planet.  But we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies and make the investments in sustainable development that we must as the nation if we are to attack the root causes of-- of the source of-- of instability.</p><p>And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.  I was in Burlington, Iowa and a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, ""Governor O'Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on-- on stage, please don't use the term boots on Iraq-- on the ground.  Please don't use the term boots on the ground.  My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.""</p><p>These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls.  And when we fall to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy and our economic power in-- alignment with our principles.</p><p>HILLARY "
"45","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, I think it's perfectly-- fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.  Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan-- elsewhere.  So there does need to be a whole of government approach.  But just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.  These are often very long-term kinds of-- investments that--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"46","SANDERS:</p><p>But when you talk about the long-term consequences of war let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.  The 500,000 who came home with P.T.S.D. and traumatic brain injury.  And I would hope that in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.  And that we stand with them as they have stood with us.</p><p>JOHN "
"47","Mods:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, you mentioned radical jihadists.</p><p>HILLARY "
"48","CLINTON:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>JOHN "
"49","Mods:</p><p>Marco Rubio, also running for president, said that this attack showed-- in-- the attack in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam.  Do you agree with that characterization, radical Islam?</p><p>HILLARY "
"50","CLINTON:</p><p>I don't think we're at war with Islam.  I don't think we at war with all Muslims.  I think we're at war with jihadists who have--</p><p>JOHN "
"51","Mods:</p><p>Just to interrupt, he-- he didn't say all Muslims.  He just said radical Islam.  Is that a phrase you don't--</p><p>HILLARY "
"52","CLINTON:</p><p>I-- I think that you can-- you can talk about Islamists who-- clearly are also jihadists.  But I think it's-- it-- it's not particularly helpful to make the case that-- Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with that we've gotta reach out to Muslim countries.  We've gotta have them be part of our coalition.</p><p>If they hear people running for-- president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam-- that was one of the real contributions-- despite all the other problems that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a mosque in Washington, ""We are not at war with Islam or Muslims.  We are at war with violent extremism.  We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.""  And yes, we are at war with those people that I don't want us to be painting with too brand a brush.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"53","Mods:</p><p>The reason I ask is that you gave a speech at Georgetown University in which you said that it was important to show-- quote-- respect even for one's enemy.  Trying to understand and in so far as psychologically possible empathize with their perspective and point of view.  Can you explain what that means in the context of this kind of barbarism?</p><p>HILLARY "
"54","CLINTON:</p><p>I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism-- it's very hard to understand other than the lust for power, the rejection of (UNINTEL), the total disregard for human life-- freedom or any other value that we know and-- respect.</p><p>Historically it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.  I-- I plead (?)-- that it's very difficult when you deal with-- ISIS and organizations like that whose-- whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious-- that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power.  And that's very difficult to put ourselves in other shoes.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"55","Mods:</p><p>Very quickly, do either of you-- radical Islam, do either of you use that--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"56","Mods:</p><p>phrase?</p><p>BERNIE "
"57","SANDERS:</p><p>I don't think the term is what's important.  What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaeda who do believe we should go back several thousand years, we should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.  And that this world with American leadership can and must come together to destroy them.  We can do that.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"58","MALLEY:</p><p>John--</p><p>BERNIE "
"59","SANDERS:</p><p>And it requires an entire will to come together including, in a very active way, the Muslim nations.</p><p>JOHN "
"60","Mods:</p><p>Governor O'Malley, you've been making the case-- when you talk about lack of forward vision, you're essentially saying that Secretary Clinton lacks that vision.  And this critique matches up with this discussion of language.  The critique is that the softness of language betrays a softness of approach.  So if this language-- if you don't call it by what it is, how can your approach be effective to the cause.  That's the critique.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"61","MALLEY:</p><p>I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis, that's to call what it is.  But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim-American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.  They are our first line of defense.</p><p>And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there as well as in this world-- because of the Muslim-Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.  And now like we never before-- we need our Muslim-American neighbors to stand up and to-- and to be a part of this.</p><p>JOHN "
"62","Mods:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, the-- French president has called this attack an act of war.  A couple of days ago you were asked if you would declare war on ISIS and you said no.  Would you-- would you-- what would you say now?</p><p>HILLARY "
"63","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, we-- we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.  We-- passed it after 9/11.</p><p>JOHN "
"64","Mods:</p><p>And you think that covers all of it?</p><p>HILLARY "
"65","CLINTON:</p><p> It-- it certainly does cover it.  I-- I would like to see it updated.</p><p>JOHN "
"66","Mods:</p><p>20:28:20:00  If you were in the Senate-- if you were in the Senate would you be okay with-- the commander in chief doing that without coming back to you?</p><p>HILLARY "
"67","CLINTON:</p><p>No.  It would have to go through the Congress.  And I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.  Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.</p><p>You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lotta these places.  But we have to keep trying.  And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters who have gone to Syria, especially the ones with-- with western passports that come back.  So there's a lot of work we need to do.  And I wanna be sure that what's called the AUMF has the authority that is needed going forward.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"68","Mods:</p><p>Let me just-- let that is-- whatever you've got to say refugees.  You've been a little vague about what you've done in the Syrian refugees.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"69","Mods:</p><p>I mean, what's your view on them now--</p><p>BERNIE "
"70","SANDERS:</p><p>Let me pick up an issue that-- a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.  This nation is the most powerful military in the world.  We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military.  And yet significantly less than 10% of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.</p><p>We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars (UNINTEL), 5,000 nuclear weapons.  I think we need major reform in the military making it more cost effective but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.  The Cold War is over and our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting international terrorism.</p><p>In terms of refugees I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that of course we reach out.  Now what the magic number is, I don't know.  Because we don't know the extent of the problem.  But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those.</p><p>JOHN "
"71","Mods:</p><p>Governor O'Malley, you have a magic number.  I think it's 65,000.  Does that number go up or down based on what happened yesterday?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"72","MALLEY:</p><p>John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were s-- were fleeing the sort of murder of-- of ISIL.  And I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.  But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country, people of 320 million is akin to making room for six and a half more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.</p><p>There are other ways to lead than to be a moral leader in this world rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.  But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says, the nature of warfare has changed.  This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of (UNINTEL).  This is-- a new era of conflict where traditional ways of-- of huge standing armies are not as-- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.</p><p>JOHN "
"73","Mods:</p><p>Just very quickly, 65,000, the number stays?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"74","MALLEY:</p><p>That's what I understand is the request from the international--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"75","Mods:</p><p>But-- what would you want?</p><p>MARTIN O'"

"78","Mods:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, let me ask you a question from Twitter that's come in.  And this is a question on this issue of-- of refugees.  The question is with the U.S. preparing to absorb Syrian refugees, how do you propose we screen those coming in to keep our citizens safe?</p><p>HILLARY "
"79","CLINTON:</p><p>I think that is the number one requirement.  I also said that we should take-- increased numbers of refugees.  The administration originally said ten.  I said we should go to 65 but only if we have as carefully screening and vetting process as we can imagine whatever resources it takes.</p><p>Because I do not want us to-- in any way-- inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.  But I wanna say a quick word about what-- Senator Sanders and-- and then O-- and Governor O'Malley said.  We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget.  And we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.  But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.  We got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up-- these-- military installations.</p><p>We have problems with Russia.  Just the other day Russia allowed a-- television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.  So we've gotta look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about have-- having more streamlined and focused--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"80","Mods:</p><p>Senator Sanders, I'm sorry, we're gonna have to take a break now.  We will have more of the Democratic debate here from Drake University in Des Moines, (APPLAUSE) Iowa.</p><p> JOHN "
"81","Mods:</p><p>Wanna turn now from terrorism to another important issue for many Americans, the financial squeeze on the middle class.  For that, we go to my CBS News colleague, Nancy Cordes.  Nancy?</p><p>NANCY "
"82","CORDES:</p><p>John, thanks so much.  We've learned a lot during the course of this campaign about the is that you'd like to do-- that you think help the middle class.  So we haven't learned quite as much about who would pick up the tab.  So Secretary Clinton, first to you, you want to cap individual subscription drug costs at $250 a month.  You want to make c-- public college debt free.  You want community college to be free altogether and you want mandatory paid family leave.  So who pays for all that?  Is it employers?  Is it the taxpayers?  And which taxpayers?</p><p>HILLARY "
"83","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.  I have made very clear that-- hard-working, middle class families need a raise, not a tax increase.  In fact-- wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since-- the turn of the last century after my husband's administration.  So we have a lotta work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.</p><p>And I have laid out specific plans.  You can go to my website, HillaryClinton.com and read the details.  And I would pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions and other kinds of favorable treatment.  And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably-- manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>But a quick follow-up on that $250 a month a cap.  Wouldn't the pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies just pass that cost onto the consumers in the form of higher premiums?</p><p>HILLARY "
"84","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, we're gonna have to redo the way the prescription drug-- industry does business.  For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.  In fact, American-- consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we helped to be developed through the National Institutes of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.  So there's more to my plan than just the cap.  We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>Governor O'Malley, you also want to make public college debt free, you want to--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"85","MALLEY:</p><p>That's right.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p> --tuition.  You've got your own family leave plan.  How would you pay for it?  In Maryland you raised the sales tax, you raised the gas tax and you raised taxes on families making over $150,000 a year.  Is that the blueprint?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"86","MALLEY:</p><p>Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we follow was, yes, we did, in fact, raise the-- the sales tax by a penny.  And we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.  And, yes, we did ask everyone the-- the top 14% of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax.</p><p>And we were the only state to go four years without a penny's increase to college tuition.  So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things in a state that (UNINTEL) not only a triple A bond rating but the highest medium income in America.</p><p>I believe that we paid for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure and research and development and also climate change-- by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people.  And that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay, namely a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.  I believe capital gains for the most part should be taxed the same way we tax incomes from hard work, sweat and (UNINTEL).  And if we do those things we can be-- a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>Senator Sanders, you want to make public college free altogether.  You want to increase social security benefits.  And you want to spend-- spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.  So you said that to do some of these things you'll impose a tax on top earners.  How high would their rate go in a Sanders administration?</p><p>BERNIE "
"87","SANDERS:</p><p>Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.  That is what I wanna do.  That is what has to happen if we're gonna revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.  In the last 30 years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.  And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.</p><p>The problem is this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.  Trillions of dollars have gone to the middle class and working families to the top 1/10 of 1% who have doubled the percentage of wealth (UNINTEL).  Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax because they're stashing their money in the Cayman Islands.</p><p>Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.  We bailed out Wall Street.  It is their time to bail out the middle class.  Help our kids be able to go to college tuition free.  So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporation who </p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>Well, let's get specific, how high would you go?  You said before you'd go above 50%.  How high?</p><p>BERNIE "
"88","SANDERS:</p><p>We haven't come up with an exact number yet.  But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90%.  But it will be-- (LAUGHTER)</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"89","SANDERS:</p><p>I'm not a socialist compared to Eisenhower.  (LAUGHTER) But-- (CHEERING) but-- but we are gonna end the absurdity as Warren Buffet often reminds us--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"90","MALLEY:</p><p>That's right.</p><p>BERNIE "
"91","SANDERS:</p><p>--that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.  That makes no sense at all.  There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest (UNINTEL) corporations will pay when I'm president.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"92","MALLEY:</p><p>I mean, (UNINTEL) under Ronald Raegan's first term the highest marginal rate was 70%.  And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy millionaire and billionaire category great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, Americans say that health care costs and wages are their top financial concerns.  And health care deductibles alone have risen 67% over the past five years.  Is this something that Obamacare was designed to address?  And if not, why not?</p><p>HILLARY "
"93","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.  We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.  And it was not only a great accomplishment to the Democratic Party but of President Obama.</p><p>I do think that it's important to defend it.  The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.  They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.</p><p>I wanna build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.  I would certainly tackle the cost issues because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were gonna have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the cost of particularly prescription drugs but other out of pocket expenses down.</p><p>But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality affordable health care for everyone.  And it's-- it's a worthy debate.  It's an important one that we should--</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>Is it--</p><p>HILLARY "
"94","CLINTON:</p><p>--be engaged in.</p><p>QUESTION #3:</p><p>--it is a worthy debate.  Senator Sanders, a quick response and then we'll get-- into health care again later.</p><p>BERNIE "
"95","SANDERS:</p><p>I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.  We have made some good progress.  Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.  I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take American (UNINTEL) Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for 1/10 the price they were paying in the United States.</p><p>But at the end of the day no doubt the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.  I think we all support it.  I believe we've gotta go further.  I wanna end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.</p><p>(CHEERING) Also-- also what we should be clear about is we end up spending-- I think the secretary knows this-- far more per capita on health care than any other major country and our outcomes-- health care outcomes are not necessarily--</p><p>MARTIN O'"

And tonight we're in Pope County for our 11th president with three people who hope to be number 45.  Joining me now to question them are Iowan Keven Cooney of KCCI and Kathie Obradovich of the Decides Moines Register, Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN "
"106","KOONEY:</p><p>Thanks John.  Candidates, we've already-- heard your answers on what you would do with Syrian refugees.  With a crucial part of the immigration debate here at home controlling our own borders.  Republican say the borders, security borders is a top priority.  Democrats say they wanna plan for comprehensive integration reform.  So Governor O'Malley, are you willing to compromise on this particular issue to focus on border security first if they were keeping the country safe?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"107","MALLEY:</p><p>Well, security-- we've actually been focusing on do-- border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.  In fact if more border security and the-- and more and more deportations we're going to bring our republican brothers and sisters to the table it would've happened long ago.  The fact of the matter is-- and let's say it in our debate because you'll never hear this from that-- immigrant bashing carnival barker Donald Trump, (LAUGH) the truth of the matter is-- (APPLAUSE) the truth is matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.  Fact check me, go ahead, check it out.  But the truth of the matter is if we want wages to go up we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of the (UNINTEL) shadow economy and into the full light of an American economy.</p><p>That's what our parents and grandparents always did.  That's what we need to do as a nation.  Yes, we must protect our borders.  But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people-- many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.  Our symbol is the Statue (APPLAUSE) of Liberty.  It is not a barbed wire fence.  Thank you.</p><p>KEVIN "
"108","KOONEY:</p><p>Now, Secretary Clinton, you have said you would go further than the president when it comes to taking executive action to implement immigration reforms.  But the President's already facing legal troubles on this.  We've seen it more just in the past week.  Realistically how can you go further with executive action?</p><p>HILLARY "
"109","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, first of all, I know that-- the president has appealed the-- decision-- to the Supreme Court.  And my reading of the law and the Constitution-- convinces me that the president has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents because I think all of us on this stage agree that-- we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.</p><p>Border security has always been a part of that debate.  And it is a fact that the-- net immigration from-- Mexico and south has basically zeroed out.  So what we wanna do is to say, ""Look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.""  They have children who are doing so well.  I've met and worked with dreamers.  I think any parent would be so proud of them.  So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have (APPLAUSE) their kids-- (INAUDIBLE PHRASE)</p><p>KATHIE "
"110","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>Senator Sanders-- you guys have talked about immigration as being a wage issue in the United States.  And I wanna actually go directly to the wage issue now.  You've talked about raising to $15.00 an hour everywhere in the country.  But the President's former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Alan Krueger has said the national increase of $15.00 could lead to undesirable and unintended consequences like job loss.  What level of job loss would you consider unacceptable?</p><p>BERNIE "
"111","SANDERS:</p><p>Let me say this-- you know, no public policy doesn't have in some cases negative consequences.  But at the end of the day what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because that wages that they are earning are just too low.  Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.  So I believe that in fact this country needs to move toward a living wage.</p><p> It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week that person should not be living in poverty.  It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.  So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, that over the next few years we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage $15.00 bucks an hour.  And I apologize to nobody.</p><p>KATHIE "
"112","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>But you said the-- the-- (APPLAUSE) you said there-- there are consequences for-- for any policy.  Do-- do you think job losses are a consequence that are--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"113","SANDERS:</p><p>This is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is ten percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.</p><p>You have no disposable income when you're making ten, $12.00 bucks an hour.  When we put money into the hands of working people they're gonna go out for our goods.  They're gonna go out for our services.  And they are gonna create jobs in doing that.  That is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"114","MALLEY:</p><p>Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.  We actually did it.  Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage we were the first to pass a minimum wage.  And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which hardly ever says nice things about democratic governors anywhere made our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><p>We defended the highest median income in the country.  And-- so look, the way the-- the-- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.  And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money.  And our whole economy grows.  We did it.  And it worked.  And nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of the--</p><p>KATHIE "
"115","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>You're calling for a $15.00-- minimum wage.  But why did you stop at $10.10 in your state?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"116","MALLEY:</p><p>$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.  But two of our counties actually went to $12.80.  And their county executives if they were here tonight would also tell you that it works.  The fact of the matter is the more our people earn the more money they spend and the more our whole economy grows.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"117","MALLEY:</p><p>This is not an esoteric article-- argument.  And you're seeing cities like Seattle, you're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it.  And they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.</p><p>HILLARY "
"118","CLINTON:</p><p>But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.  He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage-- and what its effects-- are.  And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.  However what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15.00 there are no international comparisons.  That is why I support a $12.00 national federal minimum wage.  That is what the democrats in the senate have put forward as-- proposal.</p><p>But I do believe that is a minimum.  And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.  It's what happened in-- Governor O'Malley's state.  There was a minimum wage at the state level.  And some places went higher.  I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12.00 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>MARTIN O'"

"139","Mods:</p><p>Good evening again as we begin the second half of the debate.  And joining me in the questioning are-- candidates, our CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, Kevin Cooney of CBS Good Morning affiliate KCCI and Kathie Obradovich of the Des Moines Register. As those who watched the first hour now our topic is Wall Street for those just joining us, welcome.  Senator-- excuse me, Secretary Clinton this time, went to the past there for a moment, Senator Sanders recently said quote, ""People should be suspect of candidates who receive large sums of money from Wall Street and then go out and say, ""Trust me, I'm going to reregulate Wall Street.""  So you've received millions of dollars in contributions and speaking fees from Wall Street companies.  How do you convince voters that you're gonna level the playing field when you're indebted to some of the biggest players?</p><p>HILLARY "
"140","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, I-- I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.  You've got two billionaire hedge fund managers who've started a super PAC.  And they're advertising against the (UNINTEL) as we speak.  So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do.  And you you can look at what I did in the senate.  I did introduce legislation to reign in-- compensation.  I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena and specifically said to Wall Street that-- what they were doing in the mortgage was bringing our country down.</p><p>I've laid out a very aggressive-- plan to reign in Wall Street not just the big banks.  That's a part of the problem.  And I am going right at them.  I've got a comprehensive, tough plan.  But I went further than that.  We have to go after what's called the shadow banking industry, those hedge funds.  Look at what happened in '08, AIG a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.  So I wanna look at the whole problem.  And that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.</p><p>JOHN "
"141","Mods:</p><p>Senator Sanders, you've-- you've said that the donations to Secretary Clinton are compromising.  So what did you think of her answer?</p><p>BERNIE "
"142","SANDERS:</p><p>Not good enough.  (LAUGH) Here's the story.  I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.  Why do-- why over her political career has Wall Street a major-- the major-- campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?  You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're gonna get.  But I don't think so.</p><p>Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street, it ain't complicated.  You got six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 per-- equivalent to 50-- six percent of the GDP in America.  They issue two thirds of the credit cards and one third of the mortgages.  If Teddy Roosevelt, the good republican, were alive today you know what he'd say?  ""Break them up.  Reestablish (APPLAUSE) (UNINTEL) like Teddy Roosevelt (UNINTEL) that is leadership.  So I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.  I'm not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.  I will break up these banks, support community banks and credit unions-- credit unions.  That's the future of banking in America.</p><p>JOHN "
"143","Mods:</p><p>Quick follow-up because you-- you-- (APPLAUSE) Secretary Clinton, you'll get a chance to respond.  You said they know what they're going to get.  What are they gonna get?</p><p>BERNIE "
"144","SANDERS:</p><p>I have never heard a candidate, never, who's received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate, go, ""OH, these-- these campaign contributions will not influence me.  I'm gonna be independent.""  Now, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?  They expect to get something.  Everybody knows that.  Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.  We are relying on small campaign donors, $750,000 and $30 apiece.  That's who I'm indebted to.</p><p>HILLARY "

(LAUGH) You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small, I am very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.  (APPLAUSE) So I-- I represented New York.  And I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.</p><p>Where were we attacked?  We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.  I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.  That was good for New York.  It was good for the economy.  And it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're gonna say.  But I look very carefully at your proposal reinstating Glass Steagall is a part of what very well could help but it is nowhere near enough.  My proposal is tougher, more effective and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"150","Mods:</p><p>Hold on, hold on, he was attacked.  Go--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"151","SANDERS:</p><p>Here's-- she touches on two broad issues.  It's not just Wall Street.  It's campaigns, a corrupt campaign finance system.  And it is easy to talk the talk about ending-- Citizens United.  But what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions.</p><p>And that's what I'm doing.  In terms of Wall Street I respectfully disagree with you, Madame Secretary in the sense that the issue is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth, when you have Wall Street spending five billion dollars over a ten year period to get re-- to get deregulated the only answer that I know is break them up, reestablish Glass Steagall.</p><p>JOHN "
"152","Mods:</p><p>Senator, we have to get Senator O'Malley in.  But no-- along with your answer how many Wall Street-- veterans would you have in your administration?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"153","MALLEY:</p><p>Well, I'll tell you what, I've said this before, I-- I don't-- I believe that we actually need some new economic thinking in the White House.  And I would not have Robert Rubin or Larry Summers with all due respect, Secretary Clinton, to you and to them, back on my council of economic advisors.</p><p>HILLARY "
"154","CLINTON:</p><p>Anyone (UNINTEL PHRASE).</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"155","MALLEY:</p><p>If they were architects, sure, we'll-- we'll have-- we'll have an inclusive group.  But I won't be taking my orders from Wall Street.  And-- look, let me say this-- I put out a proposal-- I was on the front line when people lost their homes, when people lost their jobs.</p><p>I was on the front lines as the governor-- fighting against-- fighting that battle.  Our economy was wrecked by the big banks of Wall Street.  And Secretary Clinton-- when you put out your proposal (LAUGH) on Wall Street it was greeted by many as quote/ unquote weak tea.  It is weak tea.  It is not what the people expect of our country.  We expect that our president will protect the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street.  And that's why Bernie's right.  We need to reinstate a modern version of Glass Steagall and we should have done it already.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>KATHIE "
"156","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>Well, you know, governor I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation you chose an investment banker in 2010.  So for me it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.</p><p>And I will go back and say again AIG was not a big bank.  It had to be bailed out.  And it nearly destroyed us.  Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.  It was an investment bank.  And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.  So I've said if the big banks don't play by the rules I will break them up.</p><p>BERNIE "
"157","SANDERS:</p><p>The big bank--</p><p>KATHIE "
"158","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>BERNIE "
"159","SANDERS:</p><p>Look, I don't know-- with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules.  Who are we kidding?  The business model of Wall Street is fraud.  That's what it is.  And we-- we have-- (APPLAUSE) and let me make this promise, one of the problems we have had I think all-- all Americans understand it is whether it's republican administration or democratic administration we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.  Here's my promise Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>JOHN "
"160","Mods:</p><p>All right, I wanna get to the-- bridge to the issues of guns here.  Secretary Clinton, you've said that Senator Sanders is not tough enough on guns.  But basically he now supports roughly the same things you do.  So can you tell us some of the exact differences going forward between the two of you on the issue of gun control?</p><p>HILLARY "
"161","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, I think that there are different-- records.  I-- you know, know that-- Senator Sanders-- had a different vote than I did-- when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.  That was a terrible mistake.  It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate-- legislators not just in Washington but across the country.</p><p>But just think about this, since we last debated in Las Vegas nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns, 21 mass shootings including one last weekend in Des Moines where three were murdered, 200 children have been killed.  This is an emergency.  There are a lot of things we've gotta do in our country.  Reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.  I agree with that.  That's why I've got such a good plan.  But we have to also go after the gun lobby.  And 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks, close the gun show loophole, close the out of (APPLAUSE) loophole and-- I wanna-- but I-- I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.</p><p>JOHN "
"162","Mods:</p><p>Secretary Clinton just a quick follow up, you say that-- Senator Sanders took a vote that-- on immunity that you don't like.  So if he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future-- opinions by him on this issue, why then is he right when he says you're wrong vote on Iraq tattoos you for offering your judgment?</p><p>HILLARY "
"163","CLINTON:</p><p>I-- I said I made a mistake on Iraq.  And I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleagues-- in the senate that I-- see in the audience, let's reverse the immunity.  Let's--</p><p> (OVERTALK)</p><p>HILLARY "
"164","CLINTON:</p><p>Let's go to the gun makers and tell-- on notice that they're not gonna get away with it.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"165","SANDERS:</p><p>Let's do more than reverse the immunity.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>HILLARY "
"166","CLINTON:</p><p>'Cause you think that that's a mistake.</p><p>BERNIE "
"167","SANDERS:</p><p>But let's-- let me hear it-- if there's any difference between the secretary and myself.  I have voted time and again to-- for-- for the background checks.  And I wanna see it improved and expanded.  I wanna see them do away with the gun show loophole.  In 1988 I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.</p><p>We have to do away with the strong man proposal.  We need radical changes in mental health in America.  So somebody who's suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.  But we have-- I don't know that there's any disagreement here.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"168","MALLEY:</p><p>Oh yes, there is.</p><p>BERNIE "
"169","SANDERS:</p><p>We have lots-- come forward with a consensus--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"170","MALLEY:</p><p>Yes, there is.</p><p>BERNIE "
"171","SANDERS:</p><p>--that in fact will work--</p><p>JOHN "
"172","Mods:</p><p>Senator, a mistake or not, you're-- you're-- so quickly before--</p><p>BERNIE "
"173","SANDERS:</p><p>We will talk of that bill which I agree with parts, I disagree-- I am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill and make sure-- and not a form of the bill.</p><p>JOHN "
"174","Mods:</p><p>Not a mistake.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"175","MALLEY:</p><p>John, this is another one of those examples.  Look, we have-- we have a lot of work to do.  And we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do in my own state after they-- the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive-- gun safety legislation, background checks, ban on assault weapons.</p><p>And senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.  But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.  When you ran in 2000 you said that we needed federal robust regulations.  Then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulation on the federal level.  And now you're coming back around here.  So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.  We got it done in my state by leading with principle.  And that's what we need to do as a party, comprehensive gun--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"176","SANDERS:</p><p>All due respect-- I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America.  But the issue-- and it's a lot--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"177","MALLEY:</p><p>Saved a lot of lives along the way.</p><p>BERNIE "
"178","SANDERS:</p><p>The issue is I believe and I believe this honestly and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us but I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control I believe that I am in a position to recount of the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.  The problem is--</p><p>JOHN "
"179","Mods:</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>BERNIE "
"180","SANDERS:</p><p>--people all over this country, not you Secretary Clinton, are shouting at each other.  And what we need to do (LAUGH) is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus.  And that's what I intend to do.</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>HILLARY "
"181","CLINTON:</p><p>There-- there is broad consensus.  92 percent in the most recent poll of Americans want gun safety measures.</p><p>BERNIE "
"182","SANDERS:</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>HILLARY "
"183","CLINTON:</p><p>And 85 percent of gun owners agree.  We've got the consensus.  What we're lacking is political leadership.  And that's what you and others can start providing in the senate.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>BERNIE "
"184","SANDERS:</p><p>Yes, I agree.</p><p>JOHN "
"185","Mods:</p><p>Sorry, I'm gonna bring in Nancy Cordes with a question from Twitter about this exchange.</p><p>(OFF-MIC CONVERSATION)</p><p>NANCY "
"186","CORDES:</p><p>(IN PROGRESS) --about guns but also about your conversation on campaign finance.  And Secretary Clinton, one of the tweets we saw-- said that I've never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations until now the idea being that, yes, you are a champion of the community after 9/11.  But what does that have to do with taking big donations?</p><p>KATHIE "
"187","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that-- had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.  And so yes, I did know people.  I had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds, say, ""I don't agree with you on everything.  But I like what you do.  I like how you stand up.  I'm going to support you.""  (LAUGH)  And I think that is absolutely perfect.</p><p>BERNIE "
"188","SANDERS:</p><p>Well, I-- if I might-- I-- I-- I think the issue here is that I-- I applaud Secretary Clinton.  She did.  She's the senator from New York.  She worked-- many of us supported you in trying to rebuild that devastation.  But at the end of the day Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.  Their business model is greed and fraud.  And for the sake of our economy they must-- the major banks must be broken up.</p><p>HILLARY "
"189","CLINTON:</p><p>But--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"190","MALLEY:</p><p>John, I think somewhere between the--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>NANCY "
"191","CORDES:</p><p>Senator Sanders, I'm sorry, so what is it in Secretary Clinton's record-- that shows you that she's been influenced by those donations?</p><p>BERNIE "
"192","SANDERS:</p><p>Well, there--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>BERNIE "
"193","SANDERS:</p><p>The issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass Steagall.  I led (UNINTEL PHRASE) unfortunately unsuccessfully against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.  The issue now is do we break them up?  Do we reestablish Glass Steagall?  And Secretary Clinton unfortunately is on the wrong side.</p><p>HILLARY "
"194","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, I'll tell you who's on my side, Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize winning economist who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.  Paul Volcker, one of the leading (UNINTEL) of trying to reign in the excesses has also said he does not support reinstating Glass Steagall.</p><p>So I mean, this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.  I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass Steagall.  I just don't think it would get the job done.  I'm all about making sure (APPLAUSE) we actually get results for whatever reason.</p><p>JOHN "
"195","Mods:</p><p>That's-- a final word-- the final word, Governor O'Malley, before we go to commercial.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"196","MALLEY:</p><p>John, there is not-- a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad debts.  That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton-- Clinton, that's crummy capitalism.</p><p>That's a wonderful business model if you place that bet-- the taxpayers bail you out.  But if you place good ones you pocket it.  Look, I don't believe that the model-- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders.  But Secretary Clinton, we need to step up.  And we need to protect main street from Wall Street.  And you can't do that by-- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.  I am not the candidate of Wall Street.  And I encourage--</p><p>BERNIE "
"197","SANDERS:</p><p>Let me--</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"198","MALLEY:</p><p>--everybody watching this tonight to-- please-- acknowledge that by going online at MartinO'Malley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>JOHN "
"199","Mods:</p><p>We have to-- we have to go for a commercial, I'm sorry.  We have to go for a commercial here.  We'll be right back with the democratic debate here in Des Moines, Iowa on CBS.</p><p>(THEME MUSIC)</p><p>JOHN "
"200","Mods:</p><p>Back now in Des Moines with the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Senator Sanders, I wanna start with you.  Let's say you're elected president.  Congratulations.</p><p>BERNIE "
"201","SANDERS:</p><p>Thank you.  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) Looking forward to it.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>JOHN "
"202","Mods:</p><p>You've said you'll have a revolution.</p><p>BERNIE "
"203","SANDERS:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>JOHN "
"204","Mods:</p><p>But there's a conservative revolution going on in America right now.  As John Boehner knows, and as Democrats know who have lost in state Houses across the country--</p><p>BERNIE "
"205","SANDERS:</p><p>Right.</p><p>JOHN "
"206","Mods:</p><p>--those conservatives are watching tonight and probably shaking their heads.  So (LAUGHTER) how you deal with that part of the country?  The revolution's already happening, but on the other side.</p><p>BERNIE "
"207","SANDERS:</p><p>And we are gonna do a political revolution which brings working people, young people, senior citizens, minorities together.  Because every issue that I am talking about, paid family and medical leave, breaking up the banks on Wall Street, asking the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes, rebuilding a fumbling infrastructure, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour, every one of those issues is supported by a significant majority of the American people.</p><p>Problem is, that as a result of a corrupt campaign finance system, Congress is not listening to the American people.  It's listening to the big money (UNINTEL).  What the political revolution is about is bringing people together to finally say, ""Enough is enough.  This government belongs to us, not just the billionaires.""</p><p>JOHN "
"208","Mods:</p><p>Senator, a 30-second follow-up.  We've heard already tonight that-- that your 92% of support for background checks.  Let the ar-- let's look at that as-- as an example.  If there were something 92% of the public was for, there have been these-- these mass shootings, there was emotional support behind it.</p><p>BERNIE "
"209","SANDERS:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>JOHN "
"210","Mods:</p><p>Bipartisan support.</p><p>BERNIE "
"211","SANDERS:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>JOHN "
"212","Mods:</p><p>The president, the full force of his office.</p><p>BERNIE "
"213","SANDERS:</p><p>Yup.</p><p>JOHN "
"214","Mods:</p><p>It went nowhere.  That's the model you're talking about-- nothing happened.</p><p>BERNIE "
"215","SANDERS:</p><p>What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy.  And makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the bullet-- p-- billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.  If we are not successful, if we continue the same old same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big money and trusts (?), nothing changes.</p><p>Look, I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.  What the polls are showing is that we are absolutely defeating the secretary among younger people.  We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.  That's what the political revolution is about.</p><p>JOHN "
"216","Mods:</p><p>A ques-- a question from Kathie Obradovich.</p><p>KATHIE "
"217","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>Yes.  Senator Sanders, you famously said in the last debate that you were sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.  But then you told The Wall Street Journal that the questions about whether or not Secretary Clinton's emails compromised classified information were valid questions.  So what does it mean?  Is it an issue or is it not?</p><p>BERNIE "
"218","SANDERS:</p><p>That's just media fluff.  I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.  I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's (UNINTEL).  (LAUGHTER) And the issue is-- the problem is the front pages every day were dealing (?) with that.  I didn't know I had so much power.  But after I said that, without hearing much of that, Hillary (LAUGH) (UNINTEL PHRASE).</p><p>KATHIE "
"219","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>But (UNINTEL) all right--</p><p>BERNIE "
"220","SANDERS:</p><p>What I would like for the media now (APPLAUSE) is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing while we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality and we're the only major country (UNINTEL PHRASE) paid family and medical leave.  We've gotten off of Hillary's emails, good.  Let's go to the major issues facing America.  (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>KATHIE "
"221","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>--your response.</p><p>HILLARY "
"222","CLINTON:</p><p>I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.</p><p>KATHIE "
"223","OBRADOVICH:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, your response?</p><p>HILLARY "
"224","CLINTON:</p><p>I agree completely.  (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I couldn't have said it better myself.  But-- but I-- I did wanna-- I-- I wanted to follow up.  Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.  And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people, young, old, everybody who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.</p><p>Look at what's happening with the Republicans.  They're doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.  (APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.  So we do need to take on the Republicans-- very clearly and directly.  But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he's gotten done-- (APPLAUSE) in Washington despite the Republican oppression.</p><p>JOHN "
"225","Mods:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, just one-- more question on the email question.  For Democrats, there's an F.B.I. investigation going on.  Can you satisfy Democrats who might worry about another shoe dropping?  That you and your staff have been totally truthful to them and that another shoe is not gonna drop?</p><p>HILLARY "
"226","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, I think after 11 hours that's pretty clear.  Yeah.  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) You know, I-- I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said.  And that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about and that they talk to each of us about and to contrast.</p><p>I mean, there are differences among us.  You've heard some of those tonight.  I still wanna get back to healthcare, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.  But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican--</p><p>JOHN "
"227","Mods:</p><p>What--</p><p>HILLARY "
"228","CLINTON:</p><p>--side.  And if you listen to what they say, and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen as well as what I see in their debate, they are putting forth alarming plans.  I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.  All of us believe climate change is real.  All of us want equal pay for equal work.  They don't believe in any of that.  So let's focus on what their election is really gonna be about.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>JOHN "
"229","Mods:</p><p>Another-- well, race relations is another issue everyone cares about.  And we're gonna switch to that now.  Governor O'Malley, let me ask you a question.  The-- the head of the F.B.I. recently said, ""It might be possible that some police forces are not enforcing the law because they're worried about being caught on camera.""  The acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration said a similar thing.  Where-- where are you on this question and what would you do if you were president and two top members of your administration were floating that idea?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"230","MALLEY:</p><p>Well, look-- John, I think the-- I think the call of your question is how can we improve both public safety in America and race relations in America understanding how very intertwined both of those issues are in a very, very difficult and painful way for us as a people.  Look, the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as Americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives and to do more of them.</p><p>And to stop doing the things that don't.  From my part, that's what I have done in 15 years of experiences in there and as the governor, we restored voting rights to 52,000 people, we decriminalized possession of small amounts of americ-- of marijuana.  I repealed the death penalty, and we also put in place a civilian review board.  We reported openly discourtesy and-- and lethal force and brutality complaints.</p><p>This is something that-- and I put forward a new agen-- agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience.  So as president, I would lead these efforts and I would do so with more experience and probably the attendance of more gravesites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban-- crime, loss of lives.  And-- the truth is-- I have learned on a very daily basis that yes indeed, black lives matter.</p><p>JOHN "
"231","Mods:</p><p>All right, governor.  Sen-- (APPLAUSE) se-- Senator Sanders, one of your former colleagues, an African American member of Congress said to me recently that a young African American man had asked him where to find hope in life.  And he said, ""I just don't know what to tell him about being young and black in America today.""  What would you tell that young African American man?</p><p>BERNIE "
"232","SANDERS:</p><p>Well, this is what I would say.  And the congressman was right-- according to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male maybe born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.  Fifty-one percent of high school African American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.  We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.</p><p>We're spending $80 billion locking people up disproportionately, Latino and African American.  We need very clearly major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system from top to bottom.  And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity, kill people who are unarmed, who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.  It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people (UNINTEL).  And it means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give space for freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.</p><p>JOHN "
"233","Mods:</p><p>Secretary-- Clinton, you told some Black Lives Matter activists recently that there's a difference between rhetoric and activism and what you were trying to do, which is-- was enforce law-- or get laws passed that would help what they-- were pushing for.  But-- recently at the University of Missouri, that activism was very, very effective.  So would you suggest that kind of activism take place at other universities across the country?</p><p>HILLARY "
"234","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, John, I come from-- the '60s, a long time ago.  There was a lot of activism on campus.  Civil rights activism, anti-war activism, women's rights activism.  And I do-- appreciate the way young people-- are standing up and speaking out.  Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.</p><p>But what happened-- at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color have.  And I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to-- either-- killings by police or random killings-- in their neighborhoods.</p><p>And hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.  Each one of them, you know, describes their child, had a picture.  You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.</p><p>Or a young woman who had been-- performing at President Obama's second inauguration, coming home-- absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park, getting shot by a gang member.  And of course, I-- I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.</p><p>So your original question is the right question, and it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.  It's really a question for all of us to answer.  Every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.  And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country--</p><p>JOHN "
"235","Mods:</p><p>All right.  Over to Kevin Cooney.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>KEVIN "
"236","COONEY:</p><p>Senator-- Senator Sanders-- we've heard a lot about this, your offer-- you-- you wanna offer free tuition in public universities and colleges.</p><p>BERNIE "
"237","SANDERS:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>KEVIN "
"238","COONEY:</p><p>A couple questions about this.  Fifty-three percent of those who enroll graduate.  First question, you're just throwing a lot of money away if we're looking at a third of these people are not going to complete college.</p><p>BERNIE "
"239","SANDERS:</p><p>No, it's not throwing-- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.  In Germany, many other countries do it already.  In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.  Here it's a new (?) story.</p><p>It's not just that college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.  More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the six grade or the eighth grade who don't have a lot of money, whose parents that-- like my parents, may never have gone to college.  You know what I want, Kevin?  I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to great a college education.  Because we're gonna make public colleges and universities tuition-free.  This is revolutionary for education in America.  It will give hope for millions of young people.</p><p>KEVIN "
"240","COONEY:</p><p>21:34:41:00  Well, one of the things that you want to do is to have the states pay for about a third of this $70 billion plan, correct?</p><p>BERNIE "
"241","SANDERS:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>KEVIN "
"242","COONEY:</p><p>There are 16 states that are running budget deficits right now.  Where are they expected to come up with--</p><p>BERNIE "
"243","SANDERS:</p><p>Well, I think that they're gonna be pretty smart.  If I think a lot of states will do the right thing and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.  Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same we look at a high school degree, 50 or 60 years ago.</p><p>If you wanna make it into the middle class, I'm not saying (UNINTEL), we need t-- plumbers and we carpenters and electricians.  That's for sure.  And they should get help as well.  But bottom line now is, in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or his family.  And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.</p><p>JOHN "
"244","Mods:</p><p>Governor O'Malley, jump in, yeah.</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"245","MALLEY:</p><p>Okay, thank you.  I have thought that-- (APPLAUSE) I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.  I-- I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.  And-- unlike my three distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually-- made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.</p><p>I respectfully disagree with Senator Sanders' approach.  I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.  I believe that our federal government needs to do more on programs, states need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states in-- in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government, 7% and 8% to go to college?</p><p>I mean, my dad went to c-- college on the GI bill after comin' home from Japan, flying 33 missions.  My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.  But we were proud of them on graduation day.  But we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.  (LAUGHTER) It-- it doesn't need to be that way.  We can (APPLAUSE) have debt-free college in the United States.</p><p>HILLARY "
"246","CLINTON:</p><p>Governor, if I could just jump in.  I-- I believe that we should make community college free.  We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.  You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.  I wanna use Pell grants to help defray-- the living expenses that often-- make a difference whether a young person can stay in school or not.</p><p>I disagree with free college for everybody.  I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.  It think it oughta be a compact (?), (APPLAUSE) families contribute, kids contribute, and together, we want to make it possible for our new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.</p><p>JOHN "
"247","Mods:</p><p>All right, Nancy Cordes has a question.</p><p>NANCY "
"248","CORDES:</p><p>Back to healthcare by popular demand.  First to you, Senator Sanders.  You prefer to scrap ObamaCare and move to a single-payer system, essentially Medicare for all.  You say you wanna put the private insurance companies out of business.  Is it realistic to think that you can pull the plug on a $1 trillion industry?</p><p> BERNIE "
"249","SANDERS:</p><p>It's not gonna happen tomorrow.  And it's probably not gonna happen until you have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these super PACs and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.  But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is a question.  In this great country of ours, with so much intelligence, with so much capabilities, why do we remain the only (UNINTEL) country on earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right?</p><p>Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?  Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is a hundred miles away from my door, that guarantees healthcare to all people?  It will not happen tomorrow.  But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen and I will lead that effort.  Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>NANCY "
"250","CORDES:</p><p>Secretary Clinton, back in-- (CHEERING) Secretary Clinton, back in 1994, you said that momentum for a single-payer system would sweep the country.  That sounds Sandersesque.  But you don't feel that way anymore.  Why not--</p><p>HILLARY "
"251","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, the revolution never came.  (LAUGHTER) And I waited and I've got the scars to show for it.  We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act.  And-- I don't think we should have to be defending it amount Democrats.  We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both undermining it and even repealing it.</p><p>I have looked at-- (APPLAUSE) I've looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed.  And basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminate private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program.  Puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the state to administer.</p><p>And I have to tell you, I would not want, if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my healthcare.  (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) I-- I think-- I think as Democrats, we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it  the model that we know it can be--</p><p>BERNIE "
"252","SANDERS:</p><p>Right.  Well, let me just say something--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>JOHN "
"253","Mods:</p><p>Thirty seconds--</p><p>BERNIE "
"254","SANDERS:</p><p>We don't-- we don't eliminate Medicare.  We expand Medicare to all people.  And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Accordable Care Act.  We've got states like South Carolina and many other Republican states that because of their right-wing political ideology are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.  Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is healthcare a right of all people or is it not?  I--</p><p>(OVERTALK)</p><p>MARTIN O'"

"257","Mods:</p><p>I'm sorry, I'm sorry governor.  We've got to take a break or the machine breaks down.  (LAUGHTER) You're watching the Democratic Debate here on CBS.  (APPLAUSE) (MUSIC)</p><p>Begin the final segment of this debate with something none of you saw coming.  Something quite unexpected.  Soon after your inauguration, you will face a crisis.  All presidents do.  What crisis have you experienced in your life that suggest you've been tested and can face that inevitable challenge?  Secretary Clinton, you first.</p><p>HILLARY "
"258","CLINTON:</p><p>(THROAT CLEAR) Well, there are so many.  I don't know where to start.  (LAUGHTER) I guess the one I-- I would pick is-- the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advice the president about whether or not to go after bin Laden.  I spent a lot of time in the situation room-- as secretary of State and there were many very difficult-- choices presented to us.</p><p>But probably that was the most-- challenging.  Because there was no certainty attached to it.  The intelligence was by no means absolute.  We had all kinds of-- questions that we discussed.  And, you know, at the end-- I recommended to the president that we take-- the chance-- to do what-- we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally-- bring him to justice.</p><p>It was an excruciating experience.  I couldn't talk to anybody about it.  In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband, he called all the former presidents.  And he said to Bill, ""Well, I-- I assume Hillary told you about this.""  And Bill said, ""No, no, she hasn't.""  There was nobody to talk to and it-- it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face--</p><p>JOHN "
"259","Mods:</p><p>Yeah.  Governor O'Malley, what crisis proves that you're tested?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"260","MALLEY:</p><p>John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, ""Therefore I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is the commander in chief of our country has to deal with.""  But I can tell you this.  I can tell you that-- that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very-- powerful and most-important-of-all jobs of the United States, president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.</p><p>You learn that threats always change.  You learn to create-- a security cabinet.  You learn to create feedback mechanisms.  You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.  I have been tried under many different emergencies.  And-- I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were-- inflicted by-- by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.</p><p>JOHN "
"261","Mods:</p><p>Senator Sanders, what (APPLAUSE) experience could you draw on in a crisis--</p><p>BERNIE "
"262","SANDERS:</p><p>Well-- I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veteran Affairs for two years.  And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from Korea, Vietnam, all of the wars.  People who came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.  And I've been determined to do everything that I could to make VA healthcare the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend (UNINTEL).</p><p>And we brought together legislation, supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans' organizations, which was comprehensive, clearly the best (UNINTEL) for veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.  I could only get two Republican votes on that.  And after 56 votes, we didn't get 60.  So what I have to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.</p><p>To (UNINTEL) people like John McCain, to (UNINTEL) people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the House, and work on a bill.  It wasn't the bill that I wanted.  But yet, it turns out to be one of the most significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.  You know, the crisis was, I lost what I wanted.  But I have to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.</p><p>JOHN "
"263","Mods:</p><p>All right, Senator Sanders.  We end-- (APPLAUSE) we've ended the evening on crisis, which underscores and reminds us again of what happened last night.  Now let's move to closing statements, Governor O'Malley?</p><p>MARTIN O'"
"264","MALLEY:</p><p>John, thank you.  And to all of the people of Iowa, for the role that you've performed in this presidential selection process, if you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.  Go onto MartinOMalley.com.  No hour is too short, no dollar too small.</p><p>If you-- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.  We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress.  That it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles.  Here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.</p><p>And also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back us into military corners.  There is new-- no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous (UNINTEL).  I need your help.  Thank you very, very much.  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>JOHN "

"266","CLINTON:</p><p>Well, thank you very much to-- CBS and everyone here this evening, for giving us another chance-- to appear before you.  You've heard a lot about me-- in this debate.  And I'm gonna keep talking and thinking about all of you.  Because ultimately, I think the president's job-- is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.</p><p>Starting with (APPLAUSE) our children and moving forward.  I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.  And that's what I will do as your president.  I will work my heart out.  I need your help.  All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.  Please go to HillaryClinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.  (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)</p><p>BERNIE "

We're the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.  We have the highest rate of childhood poverty.  And we're the only in the world, (UNINTEL) the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.  That's not the America that I think we should be.</p><p>But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.  Millions of people are gonna have to stand up, turn off the TVs, get involved in the political process, and tell the big monied interests that we are taking back our country.

(MUSIC)</p><p>And as the candidates are thanking each other for a good debate, Clinton, Sanders, and O'Malley now have two debates in the books, so four more to come.  So, Major Garrett, how did they do tonight and what's getting the most talked about on Twitter?  Major Garrett is with us in this finale.</p><p>MAJOR "
"269","GARRETT:</p><p> So, John, our partnership with Twitter reveals the most-talked-about moments for each of the three candidates-- when you're having this kind of conversation, it doesn't mean it's all good, it could be good and bad, but it's what drove the conversation most.  In order:  Hillary Clinton, when she defended her integrity on campaign contributions and mentioned 60% of her donors are women.  That was her big spike moment.</p><p>For Bernie Sanders, it's when he called Dwight D. Eisenhower a noted socialist for referring to his (CHEERING) income tax bracket being very high and much higher than they are now.  Martin O'Malley's big spike moment is when he called Donald Trump an immigrant-bashing-- (CHEERING) carnival barker.</p><p>And remember that as the (UNINTEL PHRASE) plan for Martin O'Malley, immigrant-bashing-- carnival barker for (CHEERING) Donald Trump.  Those are the big fight moments for the three candidates, as recorded by Twitter, our partnership with them has revealed the most interesting moments of conversation as defined by the three candidates.

We are back in the Wynn Resort in Las Vegas in the presidential battleground state of Nevada for the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign.</p><p>I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We've already welcomed the candidates on stage. They are in place at their podiums. Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight. </p><p>As the moderator, I'll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion. I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism.</p><p>Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up.</p><p>I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves.</p><p>Let's begin with Governor Chafee. </p><p>Governor?</p><p>FORMER GOV. LINCOLN CHAFEE, D-R.I.: Thank you, Anderson. </p><p>Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate.</p><p>Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision.</p><p>I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor. As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years. </p><p>As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate. I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I've always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards.</p><p>As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars. </p><p>I look forward to the discussion ahead. </p><p>Thank you (APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"273","COOPER: Thank you very much, Governor.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Senator Webb, you have two minutes.</p><p>FORMER SEN. JIM WEBB, D-VA.: Thank you.</p><p>You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. </p><p>"
"274","WEBB: They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor.</p><p>In government service, I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy -- in the Reagan administration.</p><p>In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected.</p><p>I know where my loyalties are.</p><p>My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam -- learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi.</p><p>You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.</p><p>(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"275","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, you have two minutes.</p><p>FORMER GOV. MARTIN O'MALLEY, D-MD.: My name is Martin O'Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father.</p><p>My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack. And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader.</p><p>Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals.</p><p>Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a -- deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself.</p><p>What I'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership, and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families.</p><p>Our economy isn't money, it's people. It's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt.</p><p>And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"276","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, thank you very much. Senator Sanders.</p><p>SEN. BERNARD SANDERS, I-VT.: Anderson, thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent.</p><p>As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people. </p><p>Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. </p><p>Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe -- just maybe -- we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"277","COOPER: Secretary Clinton?</p><p>FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM "
"278","CLINTON: Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. </p><p>I'm Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential. </p><p>I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. </p><p>At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. </p><p>And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. </p><p>And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them. But for me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides -- the divides economically, because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community -- so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"279","COOPER: Thank you, all. It is time to start the debate.</p><p>Are you all ready? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>All right. Let's begin. We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you. </p><p>Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency. </p><p>You were against same-sex marriage. Now you're for it. You defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you say they're too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the ""gold standard"". Now, suddenly, last week, you're against it. </p><p>Will you say anything to get elected? </p><p>"
"280","CLINTON: Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings -- including those of us who run for office -- I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world. </p><p>You know, taker the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. </p><p>And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ""this will help raise your wages."" And I concluded I could not. </p><p>"
"281","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency. Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you'd, quote, ""take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values."" </p><p>Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, ""being kind of moderate and center."" Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to? "
"282","CLINTON: No. I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience. And I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment. </p><p>You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children's Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we're going to un-stack the deck, and how we're going to make it possible for more people to have the experience I had. </p><p>You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president. </p><p>"
"283","COOPER: Just for the record, are you a progressive, or are you a moderate? </p><p>"
"284","CLINTON: I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know... </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>...how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly. But we found ways to work together on everything from... </p><p>"
"285","COOPER: Secretary... </p><p>"
"286","CLINTON: ...reforming foster care and adoption to the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures... </p><p>"
"287","COOPER: ...thank you... </p><p>"
"288","CLINTON: ...8 million kids. So I have a long history of getting things done, rooted in the same values... </p><p>"
"289","COOPER: ...Senator... </p><p>"
"290","CLINTON: ...I've always had. </p><p>"
"291","COOPER: Senator Sanders. A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House. You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States? </p><p>"
"292","SANDERS: Well, we're going to win because first, we're going to explain what democratic socialism is. </p><p>And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent -- almost -- own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. </p><p>That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have -- we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth. </p><p>Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"293","COOPER: Denmark is a country that has a population -- Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here, and that's what I'm trying to get at. </p><p>You -- the -- the Republican attack ad against you in a general election -- it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist. </p><p>Doesn't -- doesn't that ad write itself? </p><p>"
"294","SANDERS: Well, first of all, let's look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November. </p><p>Sixty-three percent of the American people didn't vote, Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn't vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country. </p><p>Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing. </p><p>"
"295","COOPER: You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though? </p><p>"
"296","SANDERS: Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't. </p><p>I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"297","COOPER: Just let me just be clear. Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist? </p><p>"
"298","CLINTON: Well, let me just follow-up on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families. </p><p>And I don't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself. And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have. </p><p>But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system. </p><p>But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history...</p><p>"
"299","COOPER: Senator Sanders? </p><p>"
"300","CLINTON: ... of the world. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"301","SANDERS: I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation. We have got to encourage that. Of course, we have to support small and medium-sized businesses. </p><p>But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. So what we need to do is support small and medium-sized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake...</p><p>"
"302","COOPER: We're going to get...</p><p>"
"303","SANDERS: ... not just for billionaires. </p><p>"
"304","COOPER: We're going to have a lot more on these issues. But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability. </p><p>Governor Chafee, you've been everything but a socialist. When you were senator from Rhode Island, you were a Republican. When you were elected governor, you were an independent. You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years. Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again? </p><p>"
"305","CHAFEE: Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. Whether it's...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"306","COOPER: It seems like pretty soft granite. I mean, you've been a Republican, you've been an independent.</p><p>"
"307","CHAFEE: Did you hear what I said? On the issues. I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I'm a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues. </p><p>And I open my record to scrutiny. Whether it's on the environment, a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate. </p><p>Time and time again, I have never changed. You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. So I have not changed.</p><p>"
"308","COOPER: Then why change labels? </p><p>"
"309","CHAFEE: The party left me. There's no doubt about that. There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party. I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. I won it. But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican. That's what we were up against.</p><p>"
"310","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor. As we all know, we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April. </p><p>The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest. Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years? </p><p>O'"
"311","MALLEY: Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest. </p><p>But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999... </p><p>"
"312","COOPER: She actually -- just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance. I mean, there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of. That distress of communities, where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old, it's a direct result of these failed policies. </p><p>O'"
"313","MALLEY: Well, let's talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death. </p><p>Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America. </p><p>And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years. </p><p>I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. </p><p>We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn't easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office. </p><p>"
"314","COOPER: In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people. The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause.</p><p>O'"
"315","MALLEY: Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."" That's true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime.</p><p>Look, none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together.</p><p>"
"316","COOPER: Thank you, Governor.</p><p>O'"
"317","MALLEY: Thank you. "
"318","COOPER: Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action ""state-sponsored racism."" In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?</p><p>"
"319","WEBB: No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. </p><p>And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, ""of color,"" other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have -- by culture, by the way.</p><p>"
"320","COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today. We're going to start with guns. The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one.</p><p>Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now, you say you're reconsidering that. Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?</p><p>"
"321","SANDERS: Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers.</p><p>Also I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too poor. I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately. "
"322","COOPER: Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?</p><p>"
"323","SANDERS: Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don't.</p><p>On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.</p><p>"
"324","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?</p><p>"
"325","CLINTON: No, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do. </p><p>Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn't that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We're not going to let it continue. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"326","COOPER: We're going to bring you all in on this. But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response. </p><p>"
"327","SANDERS: As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing. </p><p>I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue. </p><p>"
"328","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature. President Obama couldn't convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston. How can you?</p><p>O'"
"329","MALLEY: And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look, it's fine to talk about all of these things -- and I'm glad we're talking about these things -- but I've actually done them. </p><p>We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora. </p><p>Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a -- a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this -- this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going. </p><p>And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"330","COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond, 30 seconds. </p><p>"
"331","SANDERS: I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it. But here is the point, Governor. We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not. </p><p>Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together. </p><p>O'"
"332","MALLEY: Senator -- Senator, excuse me. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'"
"333","MALLEY: Senator, it is not about rural -- Senator, it was not about rural and urban. </p><p>"
"334","SANDERS: It's exactly about rural. </p><p>O'"
"335","MALLEY: Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore? Have you ever been to Western Maryland? We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas. </p><p>"
"336","SANDERS: Governor...</p><p>O'"
"337","MALLEY: And we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA.</p><p>"
"338","SANDERS: Well, as somebody who has a D-minus voting record...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'"
"339","MALLEY: And I have an F from the NRA, Senator.</p><p>"
"340","SANDERS: I don't think I am pandering. But you have not been in the United States Congress. </p><p>O'"
"341","MALLEY: Well, maybe that's a healthy thing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>"
"342","SANDERS: And when you want to, check it out. And if you think -- if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are sorely mistaken. </p><p>"
"343","COOPER: Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint. Senator Webb, your rating from the NRA, you once had an A rating from the NRA. You've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns. Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting?</p><p>"
"344","WEBB: Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that. </p><p>A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.</p><p>So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence. </p><p>"
"345","COOPER: Senator...</p><p>"
"346","WEBB: May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.</p><p>"
"347","COOPER: Senator -- Governor Chafee, you have an F rating from the NRA, what do you think about what Senator Webb just said?</p><p>"
"348","CHAFEE: Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns.</p><p>And, they're successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we've go to change this. We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.</p><p>"
"349","COOPER: I want to...</p><p>O'"
"350","MALLEY: ...Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state -- when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did. And that's why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn't...</p><p>"
"351","SANDERS: ...Excuse me...</p><p>O'"
"352","MALLEY: ...dare to petition a referendum...</p><p>"
"353","SANDERS: ...I want to make...</p><p>O'"
"354","MALLEY: ...Because we built a public consensus... "
"355","COOPER: ...I want to move on to another issue, which is in the headlines right now, another crisis making headlines.</p><p>Secretary Clinton, Russia, they're challenging the U.S. in Syria. According to U.S. intelligence, they've lied about who they're bombing. You spearheaded the reset with Russia. Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria?</p><p>"
"356","CLINTON: Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan.</p><p>There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important -- and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict.</p><p>And, to -- provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And, I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what I'm advocating.</p><p>"
"357","COOPER: Senator Sanders, what would you do differently.</p><p>"
"358","SANDERS: Well, let's understand that when we talk about Syria, you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. You're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS. You're talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad, and vice versa.</p><p>I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country. We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria.</p><p>"
"359","COOPER: On this issue of foreign policy, I want to go to...</p><p>"
"360","CLINTON: ...Well, nobody does. Nobody does, Senator Sanders.</p><p>"
"361","COOPER: I want to go to Dana Bash. Dana?</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL "
"362","CORRESPONDENT: Governor Chafee, you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war. You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq. She has since said that her vote was a mistake. Why isn't that good enough? "
"363","CHAFEE: Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history. That's very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders.</p><p>So, as we look ahead, if you're going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire -- if you're looking ahead, and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq -- I know because I did my homework, and, so, that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future. And that's what's important.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"364","BASH: Secretary Clinton, he's questioning your judgment.</p><p>"
"365","CLINTON: Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue. After the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State. </p><p>He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him... </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>...in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues. </p><p>You know, I -- I agree completely. We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria. I never said that. What I said was we had to put together a coalition -- in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department -- to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region. </p><p>Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond. </p><p>So I think while you're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran -- I think I have a lot of evidence... </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"366","BASH: Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, I want to bring you in here. My question for you is, as a congressman, you voted against the Iraq War. You voted against the Gulf War. You're just talking about Syria, but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force? </p><p>"
"367","SANDERS: Let me just respond to something the secretary said. First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a no-fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation. Could lead to real problems. </p><p>Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the -- I would urge people to go to <a href=""http://berniesanders.com/"">berniesanders.com</a>, hear what I said in 2002. And I say, without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization, in fact, did happen. </p><p>So I think... "
"368","BASH: All right. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"369","SANDERS: I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS, without getting us on the ground there, and that's the direction I believe we should have (inaudible). </p><p>"
"370","COOPER: But, Senator Sanders, you didn't answer the question. Under what -- under what circumstances would you actually use force? </p><p>"
"371","SANDERS: Well, obviously, I voted, when President Clinton said, ""let's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,"" I voted for that. I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan. </p><p>When our country is threatened, or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action. </p><p>(UNKNOWN): You're at work with our allies. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"

"373","SANDERS: I don't believe that any...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"374","COOPER: Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq, supported more troops in Afghanistan. As Secretary of State, she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya. Is she too quick to use military force? </p><p>O'"
"375","MALLEY: Anderson, no president -- no commander in chief -- should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option. </p><p>What disturbed people so much about -- and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this -- leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was -- was one of the worst blunders in modern American history. </p><p>But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at -- and saying, ""it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,"" and I thought, ""has this world gone mad?"" </p><p>Whenever we go -- and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice -- ""searching the world for monsters to destroy,"" and when we use political might to take a -- at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our (inaudible). </p><p>"
"376","COOPER: Does she -- does she want to use military force too rapidly? </p><p>O'"
"377","MALLEY: I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool. I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake. </p><p>You have to enforce no-fly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret. </p><p>I support President Obama. I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately -- you want to talk about blunders? I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder. </p><p>"
"378","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, just for the record, on the campaign trail, you've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the -- for the military intervention. Senator -- Secretary Clinton, you can respond. </p><p>"
"379","CLINTON: Well, first of all, I... </p><p>"
"380","WEBB: Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point? </p><p>"
"381","COOPER: Well -- yes, you'll be coming in next, but she was directly quoted, Senator. </p><p>"
"382","WEBB: Thank you. I've been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying. </p><p>"
"383","COOPER: OK. </p><p>"
"384","WEBB: It's just -- it's gone back and forth over there. </p><p>"
"385","COOPER: Secretary? </p><p>"
"386","CLINTON: Well, I am in the middle, here, and... </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Lots of things coming from all directions. </p><p>"
"387","WEBB: You got the lucky (inaudible). </p><p>"
"388","CLINTON: You know, I have to say, I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008, and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign. And I consider him, obviously, a friend. </p><p>Let me say -- because there's a lot of loose talk going on here -- we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq. The president has made a very tough decision. What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone -- which of course would be in a coalition -- be put on the table is because I'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table. You know, diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution. It's about how you balance the risks. </p><p>"
"389","COOPER: Thank you. </p><p>"
"390","CLINTON: And I think we have an opportunity here -- and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated -- to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political, diplomatic solution in Syria. </p><p>"
"391","COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>"
"392","COOPER: Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?</p><p>"
"393","WEBB: Look, let's start -- I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. </p><p>Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people. </p><p>"
"394","COOPER: Senator...</p><p>"
"395","WEBB: And I would say this. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this. </p><p>"
"396","COOPER: You're over your time as of now.</p><p>"
"397","WEBB: I will -- well, you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this...</p><p>"
"398","COOPER: You agreed to these debate rules. </p><p>"
"399","WEBB: ... to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that. </p><p>"
"400","COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond. "
"401","SANDERS: Pardon me? </p><p>"
"402","COOPER: I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this. </p><p>"
"403","SANDERS: Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that...</p><p>"
"404","COOPER: He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot. </p><p>"
"405","SANDERS: Well, I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy. And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now. </p><p>"
"406","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable. Should you have seen that attack coming? </p><p>"
"407","CLINTON: Well, let's remember what was going on. We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I'm sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people. We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide, in their words. And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, ""We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi."" </p><p>Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this. We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya. And I'll say this for the Libyan people.</p><p>"
"408","COOPER: But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi. </p><p>"
"409","CLINTON: But let -- I'll get to that. But I think it's important, since I understand Senator Webb's very strong feelings about this, to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time. </p><p>And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951. And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy. Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed. </p><p>But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk. </p><p>"
"410","COOPER: Governor O'Malley? </p><p>"
"411","WEBB: Can I...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>O'"
"412","MALLEY: Anderson, I think we are learning...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>O'"
"413","MALLEY: Anderson, I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi. And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends. </p><p>And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools. We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today. </p><p>And it's a huge national security failing. </p><p>"
"414","COOPER: Senator Webb, I want you to be able to respond. </p><p>"
"415","WEBB: Thank you. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"416","COOPER: Senator Webb? "
"417","WEBB: This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack. </p><p>There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings. </p><p>It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it. </p><p>"
"418","COOPER: Secretary (sic) Webb, you served in Vietnam. You're a marine. Once a marine, always a marine. You served as a marine in Vietnam. You're a decorated war hero. You eventually became secretary of the navy. </p><p>During the Vietnam War, the man standing next to you, Senator Sanders, applied for status as a conscientious objector. Given his history, can he serve as a credible commander-in-chief? </p><p>"
"419","WEBB: Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president. </p><p>I will say this, coming from the position that I've come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief. </p><p>"
"420","COOPER: Senator Sanders, tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commander-in- chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status. </p><p>"
"421","SANDERS: Well, first of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"422","SANDERS: Jim and I, under Jim's leadership, as he indicated, passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history. We followed suit with a few years later passing, under my leadership, the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"423","SANDERS: When I was a young man -- I'm not a young man today. When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam. Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war. That was my view then.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"424","SANDERS: I am not a pacifist, Anderson. I supported the war in Afghanistan. I supported President Clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do. </p><p>Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"425","COOPER: Very quickly, 30 seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? I want to go down the line. </p><p>"
"426","CHAFEE: OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama -- and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in. </p><p>No, that's not true, Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.</p><p>"
"427","COOPER: OK. Senator, I can give you 30 seconds to respond. </p><p>"
"428","WEBB: I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.</p><p>"
"429","COOPER: Thirty seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?</p><p>"
"430","CHAFEE: It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There's no doubt about it.</p><p>"
"431","COOPER: OK.</p><p>"
"432","CHAFEE: And it all started with the Iraq invasion.</p><p>"
"433","COOPER: Governor O'Malley?</p><p>O'"
"434","MALLEY: I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible).</p><p>"
"435","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat?</p><p>"
"436","CLINTON: I -- I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that's why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that.</p><p>"
"437","COOPER: Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat?</p><p>"
"438","SANDERS: The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis.</p><p>"
"439","COOPER: Senator Webb?</p><p>"
"440","WEBB: Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.</p><p>"
"441","COOPER: All right. We're going to take a short break. Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans? That is next.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>"
"442","COOPER: And welcome back. We are live in Nevada, in Las Vegas, at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate. The questions continue. </p><p>We begin with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails. For the last eight months, you haven't been able to put this issue behind you. You dismissed it; you joked about it; you called it a mistake. What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president? </p><p>"
"443","CLINTON: Well, I've taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn't the best choice. </p><p>And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails, asking that they be made public. And you're right. I am going to be testifying. I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to. </p><p>But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that's what they have attempted to do. </p><p>I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable? How are we going to pay down student debt? </p><p>"
"444","COOPER: Secretary...</p><p>"
"445","CLINTON: How are we going to get health care for everybody...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"446","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, with all due respect, it's a little hard -- I mean, isn't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue? There's an FBI investigation, and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue. </p><p>"
"447","CLINTON: Well, I never said it wasn't legitimate. I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee. </p><p>But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again. There were already seven committee reports about what to do. So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is. </p><p>"
"448","COOPER: Thank you. </p><p>"
"449","CLINTON: But I'll be there. I'll answer their questions. But tonight, I want to talk not about my e-mails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"450","COOPER: Senator Sanders?</p><p>"
"451","SANDERS: Let me say this.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Let me say -- let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"452","CLINTON: Thank you. Me, too. Me, too. </p><p>"
"453","SANDERS: You know? The middle class -- Anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well. I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people. Middle class in this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty. We have massive wealth and income inequality. Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union. Enough of the e-mails. Let's talk about the real issues facing America. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"454","CLINTON: Thank you, Bernie. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"455","COOPER: It's obviously very popular in this crowd, and it's -- hold on. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I know that plays well in this room. But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you've said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face? </p><p>"
"456","CHAFEE: Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't. So there's an issue of American credibility out there. So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That's how I feel. </p><p>"
"457","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? </p><p>"
"458","CLINTON: No. </p><p>"
"459","COOPER: Governor -- Governor...</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Governor O'Malley...</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Governor, it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers.</p><p>Governor O'Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, ""being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal.""</p><p>You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight?</p><p>O'"
"460","MALLEY: I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long -- what the FBI's asking about. Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues. Which is why -- and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table.</p><p>We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable...</p><p>"
"461","COOPER: ...Thank you, governor.</p><p>O'"
"462","MALLEY: ...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050.</p><p>"
"463","COOPER: I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN "
"464","ANCHOR: Alright, Anderson, thank you very much. I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail. Can you hear me?</p><p>Can't hear me in the room. OK, here we go again, as I said...</p><p>"
"465","WILKINS: ...law school. My question for the candidates is, do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?</p><p>"
"466","COOPER: The question from Arthur...</p><p>"
"467","LEMON: ...There we go...</p><p>"
"468","COOPER: ...Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? Let's put that question to Senator Sanders.</p><p>"
"469","SANDERS: Black lives matter.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>"
"470","SANDERS: And the reason -- the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail, or their kids...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"471","SANDERS: ...are going to get shot. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"472","SANDERS: ...In which we have more people in jail than China. And, I intended to tackle that issue. To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"473","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?</p><p>O'"
"474","MALLEY: Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color.</p><p>When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore -- and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction.</p><p>Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"475","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?</p><p>"
"476","CLINTON: Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"477","CLINTON: ...So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice -- I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing. There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on.</p><p>Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world.</p><p>But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we've got to do more about the lives of these children. That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential. That is...</p><p>"
"478","COOPER: ...Thank you, Senator...</p><p>"
"479","CLINTON: ...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education...</p><p>"
"480","COOPER: Senator...</p><p>"
"481","CLINTON: ...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there's a long list...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"482","CLINTON: ...We need a new New Deal for communities of color...</p><p>"
"483","COOPER: Senator Webb?</p><p>"
"484","WEBB: I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans.</p><p>We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide.</p><p>We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in.</p><p>I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded -- who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after -- after three years. </p><p>"
"485","COOPER: Thanks, sir.</p><p>"
"486","WEBB: And I put the African American soldier on the Mall. I made that recommendation and fought for it. So, if you want someone who is -- can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person.</p><p>"
"487","COOPER: Senator Sanders, let's talk about income inequality. Wages and incomes are flat. You've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s. We've had a Democratic president for seven years. What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn't?</p><p>"
"488","SANDERS: Well, first of all, let's remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world's financial crisis was on -- the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That's where we were.</p><p>Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"489","COOPER: Secretary Clinton...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>"
"490","COOPER: I'll let you jump in a moment. Everybody will get in on this in a moment.</p><p>Secretary Clinton, how would you address this issue? In all candor, you and your husband are part of the one percent. How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class?</p><p>"
"491","CLINTON: Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we've worked really hard our entire lives. And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs.</p><p>I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It's absolutely right. It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.</p><p>"
"492","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, (inaudible). O'"
"493","MALLEY: Yes. Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition.</p><p>But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking -- namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall.</p><p>Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today.</p><p>We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.</p><p>"
"494","COOPER: Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities.</p><p>Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage. Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks. You don't. You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them. Why is your plan better?</p><p>"
"495","CLINTON: Well, my plan is more comprehensive. And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw.</p><p>But we also have to worry about some of the other players -- AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There's this whole area called ""shadow banking."" That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.</p><p>"
"496","CLINTON: So I'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks. And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk. But I want to make sure we're going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"497","COOPER: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours. </p><p>"
"498","SANDERS: Well, that's not true. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>"
"499","COOPER: Why? </p><p>"
"500","SANDERS: Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Check the record. In the 1990s -- and all due respect -- in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, ""what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge,"" Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Today, it is my view that when you have the three... </p><p>"
"501","COOPER: Senator... </p><p>"
"502","SANDERS: ...largest banks in America -- are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"503","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond. He brought you up. </p><p>"
"504","CLINTON: Yeah. </p><p>You know, I -- I respect the passion an intensity. I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 -- before the big crash that we had -- and I basically said, ""cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors."" </p><p>I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we're going to do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk. </p><p>And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail. Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid... </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"505","COOPER: (inaudible) </p><p>"
"506","CLINTON: ...and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks. </p><p>"
"507","COOPER: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders... </p><p>"
"508","CLINTON: But I'm telling you -- I will say it tonight. If only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>"
"509","WEBB: Bernie, say my name so I can get into this. </p><p>"
"510","SANDERS: I will, just a second. </p><p>"
"511","WEBB: OK. Thank you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>"
"512","SANDERS: I'll tell him. </p><p>In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not -- Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And we have gotta break off these banks. Going to them... </p><p>"
"513","CLINTON: So... </p><p>"
"514","SANDERS: ...and saying, ""please, do the right thing""... </p><p>"
"515","CLINTON: ...no, that's not what... </p><p>"
"516","SANDERS: ...is kind of naive. </p><p>"
"517","CLINTON: ...that -- I think Dodd-Frank was a very... </p><p>"
"518","WEBB: Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible). </p><p>"
"519","CLINTON: ...good start, and I think that we have to implement it. We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart. We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board, which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We have work to do. You've got no argument from me. But I know, if we don't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach, like the plan I'm recommending, we're going to be behind instead of ahead... </p><p>"
"520","COOPER: Governor O'Malley? Where do you stand? </p><p>"
"521","CLINTON: ...on what the next crisis could be.</p><p>O'"
"522","MALLEY: Anderson, look, this is -- the big banks -- I mean, once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s (ph), the big banks, the six of them, went from controlling, what, the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP. </p><p>And -- (inaudible) right before this debate, Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things. But one of them that we still have a great difference on, Madam Secretary, is that you are not for Glass-Steagall. </p><p>You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative, risky shadow banking behavior. I am, and the people of our country need a president who's on their side, willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. </p><p>We have to fulfill... </p><p>"
"523","COOPER: Secretary Clinton... </p><p>O'"
"524","MALLEY: ...our promise. </p><p>"
"525","COOPER: I have to let you respond. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"526","CLINTON: Well, you know, everybody on this stage has changed a position or two. We've been around a cumulative quite some period of time. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know, we know that if you are learning, you're going to change your position. I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone. </p><p>But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined. </p><p>So I'm... </p><p>"
"527","COOPER: Thank you. </p><p>"
"528","CLINTON: ...not taking a back seat to anybody on my values... </p><p>"
"529","COOPER: Thank... </p><p>"
"530","CLINTON: ...my principles and the results that I get. </p><p>"
"531","COOPER: Senator Sanders... </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown. Despite that, you still voted against it. </p><p>As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability? </p><p>"
"532","SANDERS: Well, I remember that meeting very well. I remember it like it was yesterday. Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, ""guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It's going to take the economy with them."" </p><p>And you know what I said to Hank Paulson? I said, ""Hank, your guys -- you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem. How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?""</p><p>So to answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse. But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street. And by the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"533","COOPER: We're going to talk about that in a minute. </p><p>But, Senator Webb, I want to get you in. You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street. Is the system rigged? </p><p>"
"534","WEBB: There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector. </p><p>And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out. With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion. </p><p>"
"535","COOPER: You agreed to these rules and you're wasting time. So if you would finish your answer, we'll move on. </p><p>"
"536","WEBB: All right. Well, I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. This hasn't been equal time. </p><p>But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent. </p><p>That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation. They're managing money from all over the world. </p><p>We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it. </p><p>"
"537","COOPER: Governor Chafee, you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks. In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger. </p><p>"
"538","CHAFEE: The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote, I'd just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.</p><p>"
"539","COOPER: Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for? </p><p>"
"540","CHAFEE: I'd just arrived at the Senate. I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one. It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5. It was the...</p><p>"
"541","COOPER: Well, with all due respect, Governor...</p><p>"
"542","CHAFEE: But let me just say...</p><p>"
"543","COOPER: ... what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about? </p><p>"
"544","CHAFEE: I think you're being a little rough. I'd just arrived at the United States Senate. I'd been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I'd been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report. </p><p>But let me just say about income inequality. We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy. </p><p>So let's go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans. That's less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue. And they're doing fine. </p><p>"
"545","COOPER: Thank you, Governor.</p><p>"
"546","CHAFEE: So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon. I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket. And that will generate $42 billion. </p><p>"
"547","COOPER: I want to bring in Dana Bash.</p><p>"
"548","CHAFEE: And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans -- hard-working Americans. </p><p>"
"549","COOPER: Dana?</p><p>"
"550","BASH: Thank you. </p><p>CNN visited college campuses, along with Facebook. And not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue. </p><p>Senator Sanders, you've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone. Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she's not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump's kids. </p><p>Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children? </p><p>"
"551","SANDERS: Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today -- taxes in the future than they're paying today. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"552","SANDERS: But in terms of education, this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. </p><p>And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. </p><p>I think we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on. </p><p>I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>"
"553","BASH: And, Secretary Clinton, it's not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about, expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare. What's wrong with that?</p><p>"
"554","CLINTON: Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are. First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt. </p><p>As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it. So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition. </p><p>But I do believe -- and maybe it's because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school -- I think it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That's why I call it a compact. </p><p>"
"555","BASH: Secretary Clinton...</p><p>"
"556","CLINTON: But, yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week...</p><p>"
"557","BASH: Can you answer the...</p><p>"
"558","SANDERS: ... in order to make it possible for them to afford their education. And I want colleges to get their costs down. They are outrageously high in what they're charging. </p><p>"
"559","BASH: Secretary Clinton, the question was not just about tuition, though. It was about Senator Sanders' plan to expand Social Security, to make Medicare available to all Americans. Is that something that you would support? And if not, why not? </p><p>"
"560","CLINTON: Well, I fully support Social Security. And the most important fight we're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it. </p><p>"
"561","BASH: Do you want to expand it?</p><p>"
"562","CLINTON: I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security. We have a lot of women on Social Security, particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers, and they are impoverished, and they need more help from the Social Security system. </p><p>And I will focus -- I will focus on helping those people who need it the most. And of course I'm going to defend Social Security. I'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it's solvent into the future. And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means. </p><p>"
"563","SANDERS: When the Republicans -- when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. </p><p>My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by -- and I don't know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year -- you don't cut Social Security, you expand it. And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000. You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>"
"564","COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol. We're obviously in Nevada. It's had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year. Juan Carlos? </p><p>JUAN CARLOS LOPEZ, CNN EN ESPANOL "
"565","ANCHOR: Gracias, Anderson. Senator Sanders, in 2013, you voted for immigration reform. But in 2007, when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard, you voted against it. Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close? </p><p>"
"566","SANDERS: I didn't leave anybody at the altar. I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery. Guest workers are coming in, they're working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they're thrown out of the country. I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton's and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that. </p><p>"
"567","LOPEZ: Tom Harkin isn't running for president. You are.</p><p>"
"568","SANDERS: I know that. But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason. My view right now -- and always has been -- is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows. </p><p>O'"
"569","MALLEY: And Juan Carlos -- Juan Carlos...</p><p>"
"570","LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children, including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada. Do you?</p><p>"
"571","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want.</p><p>"
"572","CLINTON: Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name. I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion. </p><p>I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton. I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States. </p><p>"
"573","COOPER: (inaudible). </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Senator Sanders, does she have the right stuff? </p><p>"
"574","SANDERS: I think -- I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics. I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties -- 100,000 people in this country -- watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country. </p><p>"
"575","COOPER: we've got -- we -- a lot of questions we've got about climate change, and we're gonna go to Don Lemon. Don? </p><p>"
"576","LEMON: All right. This one is for Martin O'Malley. Anderson, Governor O'Malley, this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe, Arizona. Here it is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>"
"577","QUESTION: As a young person, I'm very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future. As a presidential candidate, what will you do to address climate change? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>"
"578","LEMON: So, Governor O'Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage. </p><p>O'"
"579","MALLEY: Yeah. </p><p>Anna, I have put forward a plan -- and I'm the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this -- to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. </p><p>We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one. </p><p>So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind. We're here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design. </p><p>We can get there as a nation, but it's going to require presidential leadership. And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the -- an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. </p><p>"
"580","COOPER: Governor... </p><p>O'"
"581","MALLEY: We can do it. </p><p>"
"582","COOPER: ...Governor O'Malley, thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats. You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are -- again, are you -- the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party? </p><p>"
"583","WEBB: Well, the -- the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change? </p><p>And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe, it is clean. And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here. </p><p>We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on -- on doing that. The -- the agreements -- the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the -- of the Chinese government itself. </p><p>So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a -- a way to address climate change. </p><p>"
"584","COOPER: Senator Sanders, are you tougher on -- on climate change than Secretary Clinton? </p><p>"
"585","SANDERS: Well, I will tell you this. I believe -- and Pope Francis made this point. This is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly. </p><p>I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon. </p><p>And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change... </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>...and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively. </p><p>This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia. </p><p>"
"586","COOPER: Senator -- thank you, Senator. </p><p>"
"587","SANDERS: The planet -- the future of the planet is at stake. </p><p>"
"588","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, I want you to be able to respond, then I'm gonna go to (ph) (inaudible). </p><p>"
"589","CLINTON: Well, that -- that's exactly what I've been doing. When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something. Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world. </p><p>They told us they'd left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said, ""We've been looking all over for you. Let's sit down and talk about what we need to do."" And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed. </p><p>Thanks to President Obama's leadership, it's now gone much further. </p><p>"
"590","COOPER: Thank you. "
"591","CLINTON: And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant. Now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there. </p><p>"
"592","COOPER: Dana Bash?</p><p>"
"593","BASH: Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave. </p><p>"
"594","CLINTON: Mm-hmm. </p><p>"
"595","BASH: Carly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company, argues, if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, ""hire fewer people and create fewer jobs."" What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can't afford it?</p><p>"
"596","CLINTON: Well, I'm surprised she says that, because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years. And it's...</p><p>"
"597","BASH: It's on the federal level. </p><p>"
"598","CLINTON: Well, but all -- well, on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world. And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have. And I think this is -- this is typical Republican scare tactics. We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses. </p><p>I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I'm supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law. I know what it's like. And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms. </p><p>I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row. She's been a champion of this. We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I'm talking about it everywhere I go, and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it. </p><p>"
"599","BASH: But Secretary -- Secretary Clinton, even many people who agree with you might say, look, this is very hard to do, especially in today's day and age. There are so many people who say, ""Really? Another government program? Is that what you're proposing? And at the expense of taxpayer money?"" </p><p>"
"600","CLINTON: Well, look, you know, when people say that -- it's always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, ""You can't have paid leave, you can't provide health care."" They don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They're fine with big government when it comes to that. I'm sick of it. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, we can do these things. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We should not be paralyzed -- we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, ""big government this, big government that,"" that except for what they want to impose on the American people. I know we can afford it, because we're going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done. </p><p>"
"601","COOPER: Thank you. Senator Sanders?</p><p>"
"602","SANDERS: Yeah, Dana, here's the point: Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby. We are the only major country. That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family -- paid family and medical leave. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Second of all, the secretary is right. Republicans tell us we can't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That's not what the American people want. </p><p>"
"603","COOPER: Governor O'Malley?</p><p>O'"
"604","MALLEY: Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave. And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce. My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids. And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and -- and keeping jobs and moving forwards. We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave. </p><p>"
"605","COOPER: Governor, thank you. The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana. I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez. </p><p>"
"606","LOPEZ: Thank you, Anderson. </p><p>Senator Sanders, right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot. You've said you smoked marijuana twice; it didn't quite work for you. If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote? </p><p>"
"607","SANDERS: I suspect I would vote yes. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"608","SANDERS: ...which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system, we we've got a lot of work to do in that area.</p><p>O'"
"609","MALLEY: Juan Carlos?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"610","LOPEZ: Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour you didn't smoke pot when you were young, and you're not going to start now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>"
"611","LOPEZ: When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told her let's wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington. It's been more than a year since you've said that. Are you ready to take a position tonight?</p><p>"
"612","CLINTON: No. I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today. I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief.</p><p>So, I think we're just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana. Therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don't have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.</p><p>"
"613","COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question.</p><p>"
"614","LEMON: Alright, Anderson. This is for Senator Sanders, OK? This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, ""President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda. How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?""</p><p>Senator?</p><p>"
"615","SANDERS: The Republican party, since I've been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists. Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no.</p><p>Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"616","SANDERS: ...But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together. If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse.</p><p>If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, ""We know what's going on. You vote against us, you are out of your job.""</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"617","COOPER: We're going to hear from all the candidates coming up. We're going to take a short break. More from the candidates in a moment.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>"
"618","COOPER: And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate. </p><p>This is a question to each of you. Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make. Each of you will have 90 seconds. But a final question to each of you. If you can, just try to -- 15 seconds if you can.</p><p>Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ""I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."" You've all made a few people upset over your political careers. Which enemy are you most proud of?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>"
"619","CHAFEE: I guess the coal lobby. I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby. But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide. I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby.</p><p>"
"620","COOPER: Governor O'Malley?</p><p>O'"
"621","MALLEY: The National Rifle Association.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"622","COOPER: Secretary Clinton?</p><p>"
"623","CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Probably the Republicans. (LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"624","COOPER: Senator Sanders?</p><p>"
"625","SANDERS: As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"626","COOPER: Senator Webb?</p><p>"
"627","WEBB: I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.</p><p>"
"628","COOPER: All right. Time for closing statements. Each of you will have 90 seconds.</p><p>Governor Chafee, let's begin with you.</p><p>"
"629","CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you, CNN. And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate.</p><p>America has many challenges confronting us -- ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans. We have many challenges. Who is best able to confront these challenges?</p><p>I've served in government at many levels. I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor. I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator. I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island. </p><p>But what I'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals. I have high ethical standards. And what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote. There was a lot of pressure -- political pressure, public pressure. But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And we live now with the consequences.</p><p>"
"630","CHAFEE: So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward. And I'm running for president to end the wars. I want to be the peacemaker. I am a proven peacemaker. Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"631","COOPER: Governor Chafee, thank you very much. Senator Webb, your final statement for 90 seconds. </p><p>"
"632","WEBB: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to be with you tonight. You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric. They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done. </p><p>One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution. </p><p>We did it with criminal justice reform. We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government. </p><p>I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of -- of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House. </p><p>"
"633","COOPER: Senator Webb, thank you very much. </p><p>Governor O'Malley, you have 90 seconds. </p><p>O'"
"634","MALLEY: Anderson, thank you. </p><p>I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight. And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very -- and all of you watching at home -- was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>On this stage -- on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief. </p><p>What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. </p><p>I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"635","COOPER: Governor O'Malley, thank you very much. </p><p>Senator Sanders, final, closing thoughts, 90 seconds. </p><p>"
"636","SANDERS: This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems. We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country. </p><p>We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and -- and parental leave -- family and parental leave to all of our families. </p><p>Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life. </p><p>Jim Webb is right: Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs. We are doing it the old-fashioned way: 650,000 individual contributions. And if people want to help us out, BernieSanders.com. We are averaging $30 bucks apiece. We would appreciate your help. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
"637","COOPER: Secretary Clinton?</p><p>"
"638","CLINTON: Thank you very much, Anderson. And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. </p><p>I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country. That's in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president. </p><p>What you have to ask yourself is: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people? Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done?</p><p>Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. It's whether you get back up. </p><p>America's been knocked down. That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. And although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way America needs to. </p><p>My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. </p><p>Please join me in this campaign. Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead. Thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>"
